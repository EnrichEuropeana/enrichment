She and her sisters collected eggs for the National Egg Collection scheme throughout the war; the eggs were sent to sick and injured soldiers in hospital. I believe the girls would put their names and addresses on the eggs and mother received two letters from one of the recipients, a gunner in the Royal Field Artillery called Arthur William Dixey. At the end of the war, my mother received a certificate for collecting the eggs. I am still amazed that at that time, the eggs travelled to France and arrived unbroken!"

However he applied for the position of quartermaster in the Territorial 5th Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was appointed to the post in July 1908. When war was declared in 1914 he volunteered for service overseas and on 14th July 1915 sailed for Gallipoli. 
George&#039;s war diary gives mainly a matter of fact account of each days activities, fighting and the conditions with some exceptions, when he gives far more detail. One particular instance is his diary entry for the 10th of August 1915 describing a march he would never forget, 3.5 miles in dreadful conditions.  Through &quot;thick shiny mud&quot; sinking up to their knees, having to rest every 120 yards he wrote that he &quot;nearly cried&quot; at the end of that day, which highlights the severity of the conditions given that George was a professional soldier with considerable service. By the end of November George had contracted conjunctivitus so severely he could not see and was  sent on the 30th November via hospital ship (Galeka) to Alexandria.  He rejoined his Battalion in February 1916 and in January 1917 was posted to Palastine. During the period 1915 - 17 he was mentioned twice in despatches."

Not content with this magnificent achievement he had to reorganise his men for an expected counter attack which duly and furiously arrived. He led his men in the defence of their position and they were successful not only in repelling the attack but also in taking more prisoners. To cap their success during the night they captured a hostile raiding party consisting of one officer, 10 men and a machine gun. He later achieved the rank of Major.

Through photographs, poetry and witness statements, I can show how I believe the current crisis in Iraq stems directly from the involvement of British and Indian troops in the region during the First World War. A British and Indian force (Force D) landed at Fao on the Shatt al-Arab River on November 6, 1914, so this is the 100 year anniversary of the beginning of British involvement in that conflict (to protect the oil pipeline) which I believe led to our current involvement in the terrible devastation happening in that country.

105452,en,"Apprentice steam engine maker, George Stanley Peachment volunteered for the army in April 1915 and became a Rifleman (Private) in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#039;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC).  It should be noted that this brave young volunteer signed with a false date of birth as he died aged 18, British Army Regulations stated that to serve overseas a man must be 19 years or over. 

Manpower shortages at this period of the war meant that training was perfunctory in practice and very short in time, illustrated by the fact that the 18 year old Rifleman Peachment was in action on the first day of the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915, some short 20 weeks later.  He was with the 2nd KRRC south of the Vermelles to Hulluch road when, during very heavy fighting, the British front line was nearly overwhelmed by the German forces and forced to retire, in the military spin of the time &#039;in order to reorganise&#039; - when infact their Division&#039;s attack had been stopped by uncut barbed wire and gassed by their own side, then expelled from ground earlier won at great cost by German counter attacks. During this &#039;retirement&#039; Private Peachment saw his company commander, Captain G.R. Dubs lying wounded, and bravely, seemingly without thought of his own safety crawled to help him. The enemy fire was intense and, although there was a shell-hole quite close in which a few men had taken cover, Private Peachment apparently, by his actions, did not place his own safety above that of a man to whom he must have felt great loyalty. He knelt in the open by this officer and tried to help him, but while doing so was first wounded in the chest by a grenade (&#039;bomb&#039;).  This did not end his selfless acts as he now, amazingly, began to drag Dubs to a place of safety.  However, sadly, in a very short time George Peachement was then mortally wounded by small arms (rifle or M.G.) fire. He was posthumously awarded the V.C. for bravery but his body was never recovered and his name has been carved into the &#039;Memorial to the Missing&#039; at &#039;Dud Corner&#039; CWGC Cemetery, Loos.

119507,en,"Dr. Eugene Clarence (E.C.) Warriner (1866-1945) was a well respected educator in the state of Michigan, United States.  After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1891, Warriner served for over 20 years in the Saginaw, MI School System.   In 1918, Warriner became the fourth President of Central State Normal School (which later became “Central Michigan University”) in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.  Presiding over the college during the difficult years of World War I, Warriner remained a steadfast advocate for peace.  He believed that public education was essential to realizing the goals of the peace movement and accordingly organized and presided over the Michigan branch of the American School Peace League which was founded in Bay City, Michigan in 1910. During his career, Warriner gave a number of speeches to teachers and students on peace, international arbitration and international law. These speeches are held by the Clarke historical library at Central Michigan University.

Document 1 titled &#039;Universal Peace and the School&#039; :
The precise date is unknown, but it was likely written around 1911 when Warriner became more involved with the Michigan Branch of the American School Peace League (which was established in October 1910). No mention of the war is made in the speech, but the speech is interesting as a complement to Documents 3 (Speech on Patriotism) and 4 (Letter from Hyman Herman).  
Taken as a whole - Documents 1 (Universal Peace and the School) , 3 (Speech on Patriotism) and 4 (Letter from Hyman Herman) illustrate how Warriner’s thinking about patriotism, citizenship and the duty of the teacher shifts after World War 1 begins. 
In Document 1 (Universal Peace and the School), teachers are exhorted to engage in a “warfare against war” and are told that “the teacher’s part in this warfare against war is to create a humble sentiment against war as a means of settling controversial disputes”.  This claim is rather different than the discussion of the teacher’s duty in Document 3 (which was written in 1915 - after the beginning of World War I, but prior to the U.S. entry to the war).  A theory of war is provided according to which man’s instincts for acquisitiveness (the desire of possession) and pugnacity (the impulse to strike at a foe) are the primary culprits.  Civilization is defined as a taming of these instincts."

Warriner's concern with the failure to publicly commemorate and hence educate the public about positive moments of “peace history”. Here we learn from Representative Kelley that instead of celebrating the centenary of the 1814 Treaty of Ghent (signifying 100 years of peace between the U.S. and the U.K.), the U.S. House of representatives chose instead in 1914 to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal with an Exposition involving the “Navies of the World”."

174745 
2nd Lt Alfred Boxall
MC RE

 

1886-1917 


Alfred Boxall was born on the 15th of July 1886 at 21 Melrose Gardens, Hammersmith, London. His father George was born in 1845 in Westminster and his occupation is listed as a cashier on Alfred’s birth certificate. His mother Charlotte (née Lingard) was born in 1858 in Pimlico, London .

In the 1891 census Alfred is not living with his family who are still at 21 Melrose Gardens. His father George’s occupation is a Railway Clerk/Cashier for Great Western Railways (GWR). There are three children on the census: Bertha aged 10, George Frederick aged 6. For some reason Charlotte is not at home on the night the census was taken, it could be that she was ill or visiting family . 

In 1891 Alfred was living in the Kensington & Chelsea District Branch School at Marlesford Lodge, 253 Kings Street in Hammersmith . The 1834 Poor Law Act led to improvements in the arrangements made for the education of pauper children. Poor Law Unions, and parishes regulated by local acts, were persuaded to establish schools and to appoint schoolmasters. The policy of separating the children from their parents (who were generally considered to be a bad influence on their children) and sending them, if possible, to the country was continued The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1844 made possible a further development in this field which was of significance for the metropolitan area. Unions and parishes were empowered to unite and to form a School District which then set up a large separate school for the education of all the indoor pauper children of the constituents of the district. These were usually industrial schools where both boys and girls were taught the basics of a useful trade which, it was hoped, would provide them with better prospects in future.
 
Kensington and Chelsea School District was founded in 1876, comprising the Poor Law Unions of Kensington and Chelsea. The School District decided not to construct a large district school, instead establishing a cottage homes development at Banstead in Surrey. This took the form of small houses reminiscent of a family home, with separate school buildings, workshops and recreation facilities. 
A branch school, Marlesford Lodge, was constructed in Hammersmith. Marlesford Lodge ""intermediate"" school opened in 1883 at a site on King's Street in Hammersmith, opposite the southern end of Ravenscourt Park. It accommodated around 132 children. This acted as a 'filter school', preventing unsuitable children from being transferred to the Banstead Homes, such those with parents in custody, those with infectious ailments and those under the age of 4 and also to minimise the time children spent in the main workhouse — any child admitted to the workhouse before 2pm was washed and despatched to Marlesford the same afternoon . It dealt with:
•	""Ins-and-Outs""
•	Children of parents in custody
•	Those suffering from slight non-infectious ailments ( Alfred had Mumps and hearing loss)
•	Those awaiting transfer to Banstead, including those falling below its minimum admission age of four
 
The site later became a home for 'mentally defective' children. In more recent times, the property became known as Palingswick House, accommodating a library and museum, and also housing a number of charities. In 2012, the site was sold to the West London Free School.
Alfred may have been ill when he was a pupil in the school. When he tried to join the army in 1914 he was rejected due to hearing loss. Mumps or measles as a child could have caused this and if he had an infectious disease this would explain why he was in the district school.
In 1901 the Boxall family are back together and living at 73 Brook Green in Hammersmith.  George Boxall is still in his occupation as a cashier for GWR and both his brothers William and George Frederick are bank clerks. His sister Bertha is a twenty year old art student. So in ten years the Boxall family have gone from sending their youngest son to a workhouse school to being able to send their daughter to art school. Alfred attended the Godolphin School in Hammersmith (which became an all girls school in 1905 and renamed the Godolphin & Latymer School) before transferring to the Merchant Taylors School (which he attended 1900-03) . The School has enjoyed a distinguished history since its foundation in 1561 by the Merchant Taylors’ Company. One of the nine original Public Schools as defined by the 1868 Act   
He obtained his 3rd Class BSc degree in Engineering from the University of London in 1907  having studied at South Western Polytechnic Engineering College in Chelsea. Founded in 1895, one of the principal aims of South-Western Polytechnic Institute was the provision of education for the poorer inhabitants of London. The Institute offered well-equipped laboratories for the study of subjects such as mechanical and electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry and metallurgy, in the hope of attracting male students keen to learn a trade and enter industry. In 1922, South-Western Polytechnic Institute evolved into Chelsea Polytechnic, which became Chelsea College of Science and Technology, before becoming a designated school of the University of London in 1971. Existing Chelsea students and courses were transferred to King’s College in 1985.  On graduation in 1907 he joined the Great Western Railway Company (GWR).
 
In 1911, according to the census, Alfred is a Civil Engineer working for GWR and is still living at 73 Brook Green with his parents and his brother George who is an Electrical Engineer, also with GWR. George senior has now retired as Chief Cashier of GWR . Alfred’s brother and sister (William and Bertha) are living at 98 Fillebrook Road, Leytonstone, Essex with William being a dental surgeon with two servants and Bertha with no employment noted . So another ten years have passed and all of George’s children are professionals. 
On Saturday 11th of March 1911 Alfred played in a football match for Shrewsbury D.E.O. against Wolverhampton D.E.O of the GWR. “The match was finely contested and resulted in a draw 1-1. At the Close of the match tea was provided and Mr Woodward (divisional engineer, Shrewsbury) presided over the subsequent smoking concert, to which the following contributed; Messrs. Boxall,.....”  The following year Shrewsbury won 2-0 and Alfred is mentioned as a singer in the smoking concert which followed the game.  On the 24th of April Alfred passed a signalling exam in Birmingham with 419 marks. 
Sometime before 1917 George senior, Charlotte, and Alfred have moved into 98 Fillebrook Road as this is address on Alfred’s attestation papers .
Alfred was commissioned as a Temporary Second Lieutenant in the 262nd Railway Company, Royal Engineers on 3rd of February 1917, although it is was not Gazetted but marked as “On Probation”.   .
 
The contribution to the war effort, especially on the Western Front, of the designated Railway Construction Companies of the Royal Engineers is largely overlooked and/or not researched in most accounts of the conflict. Given the fact that the earliest troop movements gave rise to the phrase ""war by timetable"" and that the railway was the primary means of movement of men, munitions and supplies, the important if unglamorous role of this military function cannot be underestimated. 

Very large numbers of the employees of British railway companies were then volunteering for military service and the men for RE Railway units were selected from them. By the end of 1917, out of 180,000 enlistments from English railway companies, about 40,000 were serving in RE Railway units.
The HQ of the regular railway troops before the war was at Longmoor in Hampshire, nearly 1,700 officers and 66,000 other ranks were sent overseas from this centre. Approximately half the officers for the new units were provided by the British railway companies on the recommendation of the Railway Executive Committee and the other half were mainly men from overseas who had been employed on colonial and foreign railways. 
Once in France, the sappers would be assigned to a Construction Train, of which there were eight in operation in mid-1915. Each Construction Train would have a complement of up to two complete Railway Companies, with a Captain as officer commanding the train. This enabled the sappers to carry both themselves and all their necessary tools and equipment to and from wherever the next work was required. The Companies would pitch tents for accommodation, as required. Large-scale work would include the construction of the major stores and ammunition dump at Audruicq, ten miles from Calais. Here, and at numerous other locations such as the nearby major ammunition dump at Zeneghem Yard, there was great use of Chinese Labour and R.E. Labour Companies to prepare the ground, ready for the platelaying sappers.
As the various campaigns and battles unfolded, RE Railway Companies were engaged all over the British sector, close examination of the period maps bear testimony to miles of what was to be temporary track that criss-crossed the area. Howitzer Spurs, Ambulance Train Sidings, Tank Enablements and bridges were all constructed, in addition to the constant maintenance and line doubling. Work in progress was always a potential target for enemy artillery and also there were the attentions of the German Air Force to contend with.
 

A primary objective was always to take standard gauge railways as close to the front as possible, to lessen the demands on light railway systems, horsed transport and manpower. For the sappers, work could mean toiling around the clock, especially where lines had been cut by shellfire. Inevitably there were casualties; analysis of the records shows that 173 men from Railway Companies lost their lives. The Railway Companies gradually began to be demobilised and by August 1919 the last Company had laid its last sleeper.
The 262nd Railway Company was the third of such companies made up from men of the GWR (Great Western Railway) in February. The formation is report as follows:
“During the last few weeks, at the request of the War Office, another complete Great Western Railway Construction Company, Royal Engineers, to be known as the 262nd Company, was raised. The Company consist of 1 draughtsman, 2 clerks, 200 platelayers, 20 carpenters, 7 masons and bricklayers, 10 blacksmiths, 5 strikers, 5 fitters, and 2 cooks. The following have been given commissions in this company:-
Mr O.T. Wood, chief assistant to the divisional engineer, Paddington, as Captain.
Mr F.G. Price, of the divisional engineer’s office, Paddington, and Mr A. Boxall, of the Divisional engineer’s office, Shrewsbury, as Second Lieutenants.
The men are now in camp undergoing training for service overseas.” 
 The War Diary reports:
“On the 26th of February 1917 the Company left Longmoor at 7AM having marched from billets at Greatham where the greater part of the unit arrived in civilian clothes, the unit went overseas six men understrength. The following were the names of the officers: Capt G S Hasell in command, Capt D T Wood, 2 Lieuts R. Gibb, S J Askham, F G Price, A Boxall.
The Company having left Southampton at 9PM 26-2-17 on the SS “Caeserea”, landed at Le Harve at 5PM 27-2-17. Departed Le Harve at 2AM 3-3-17 the unit detrained at Bailleul and was accommodated in billets near Dranoutre where they were employed on constructing the “Clapham Junction to Bruloose Line”
On the 8th of March (No.3 Platoon, under Lt Boxall), detachment of one officer and thirty other ranks left for Poperinghe where they were engaged in maintaining lines in the Ypres Salient and constructing a subsidiary Railway Stores Park at Railhoek. A further detachment  of 19 men left for Poperinghe on the 17th of March (meaning Alfred had 49 men under his command)” 
In May 1917 they were in the Brandhoek area, getting ready for the push on Ypres and were living in a special train of 27 wagons instead of tents, often ""visited"" by Richthofen and his circus. 

The War Diary continues:
 “During this month (June) A Boxall awarded the MC and Sgt Greening the MM for work in the Ypres Gun Spur.
On the 25th of October No 3 Railway Wood howitzer spur and No 2 spur Ravine Wood ready for use. Also earthworks for No Man’s Land Station on the Roulers Line (from Hell Fire Corner) was begun. During this month (October) ii LT BOXALL Killed” 
The unit moved around quite a bit, charged with pushing new railway lines down to the new casualty clearing stations and gun being set up in the summer months in preparation for the Passchendaele Offensive. Medical units nicknamed as Dosinghem, Bandaghem and Mendinghem, as well as GodWearsVelvet, are mentioned in the diary. The diary says that when he was hit by enemy shellfire, he was engaged in laying railway lines from Hellfire Corner out into No Man's Land . At one point he is working about 600 yards from Hellfire Corner. 
2nd Lt Alfred Boxall RE died of his wounds on the 25th of October 1917  at the 2nd Australian Field Ambulance BEF (1st Australian Division)  in Ypres in France . He was 31. At the time of his death his parents, George and Charlotte Boxall, were living at 98 Fillebrook Road.   A report in The Railway Magazine, Vol 42 Jan-Mar 1918 said:
 

This report also appeared in the Great Western Railway Magazine:
 
He was buried at Asylum British Cemetery, Ypres , which was established in the grounds of a mental hospital (the Hospice du Sacre Coeur) a little West of the railway station, between the Poperinghe road and the railway. It was used by Field Ambulances and fighting units from February 1915, to November 1917, and it contained the graves of 265 soldiers from the United Kingdom. 
After the war he was removed and buried in the Bedford House Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery outside Ieper (Ypres), West-Vlaanderen, Belgium in Enclosure No. 2, Section IV, Row A, Grave 6. His entry on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission says that his parents were living at 81 Wallwood Rd., Leytonstone, London by the time he was reburied. Enclosure No.2 was begun in December 1915, and used until October 1918. After the Armistice, 437 graves were added, all but four of which came from the Ecole de Bienfaisance and Asylum British Cemeteries, at Ypres. 
 
Bedford House Cemetery is located 2.5 Km south of Ieper town centre on the Rijselseweg (N336), the road connecting Ieper to Armentieres. Zillebeke village and most of the commune were in the hands of Commonwealth forces for the greater part of the First World War, but the number of cemeteries in the neighbourhood bears witness to the fierce fighting in the vicinity from 1914 to 1918.  Bedford House, sometimes known as Woodcote House, were the names given by the Army to the Chateau Rosendal, a country house in a small wooded park with moats. Although it never fell into German hands, the house and the trees were gradually destroyed by shell fire. It was used by field ambulances and as the headquarters of brigades and other fighting units, and charcoal pits were dug there from October 1917.In time, the property became largely covered by small cemeteries; five enclosures existed at the date of the Armistice, but the graves from No.1 were then removed to White House Cemetery, St. Jean, and those from No.5 to Aeroplane Cemetery, Ypres. 
 
In all, 5,139 Commonwealth servicemen of the First World War are buried or commemorated in the enclosures of Bedford House Cemetery. 3,011 of the burials are unidentified but special memorials commemorate a number of casualties known or believed to be buried among them. Other special memorials name casualties buried in other cemeteries whose graves could not be found on concentration. Second World War burials number 69 (3 of which are unidentified). There are 2 Germans buried here.
Alfred was not married at the time of his death and his estate and personal effects (his CO sent a brown suitcase of effects)  went to his father George. His estate was valued at £310 in 1918 or about £17,000 today. A lot of the pages in his service record are about the pay, allowances, and gratuity due to Alfred’s estate and the letters of administration. 
He had a bank account with army agents Cox & Co of 18 Charing Cross, London.  who date back to 1758. The term Army Agent comes from the days when commissions were purchased and the agents handled the financial transactions involved. By 1914 they acted as any normal bank, but the majority of officers had their accounts with them since they understood the army way of life. Indeed, many wartime officers had not held a bank account and were encouraged to join Cox & Co. The officer was regarded as a gentleman and his word was seen as his bond. Hence people trusted a cheque from an officer. To issue a dud or 'stumer' cheque was a court-martial offence and during the war a not insignificant number of officers were tried for this. However, the firm did not just issue pay and manage officers’ bank accounts. Its Insurance Department could arrange to insure the officer’s kit; the Income Tax Department could deal with his tax returns; and the Standing Order Department would ensure that his tailor was paid regularly. Cox’s also sent a cashier with a supply of money to every hospital ship as it arrived, to enable wounded officers to cash cheques.
 
Alfred’s Obituary was published in the Taylorian from Merchant Taylor’s School. It Says:
“Second Lieutenant Alfred Boxall, R.E., was the youngest son of George and Charlotte Boxall, late of Hammersmith, and now of Leytonstone, and was 31 years of age. His education began at Goldophin School, Hammersmith, but on the dissolution of that school he transferred to Merchant Taylors’. He subsequently went through an engineering course of training at the South-Western Polytechnic, Manresa Road, Chelsea, and in 1908 obtained the degree of B.Sc. (Engineering) of the University of London. He then entered the service of the Great Western Railway Company in their Engineering Department, and became an assistant engineer in the Shrewsbury division of that company. Upon the outbreak of the war he offered his services, but was rejected on account of defective hearing. He was, however, subsequently appointed to a commission in a Railway Construction Company formed for service on France in February  last and killed instantaneous by a high explosive shell while in the discharge of his duty on October 25th last. He was universally liked by all who knew him, and his superior officers speak in the highest praise of his efficiency in the discharge of his duties in very trying conditions and of his popularity with the officers and men of his company.”  
On the 1st of January 1918 the Military Cross which Alfred was awarded was Gazetted.  The 262nd Railway Company’s war diary in June 1917 states that it was an immediate award for his work on the Ypres gun spur (i.e. laying railway lines to forward gun positions) during that month. You will see from the diary there are a remarkable number of awards in the field to both officers and men of the 262 Railway Company, which either means they had a CO who was free with his powers, or this was a little band of men required to make the impossible possible in the teeth of enemy shellfire; reading the war diary, it is hard not to conclude the latter scenario is the truth of the situation.  Despite research no citation has yet been found for his Military Cross. It is usually true to say that Military Crosses gazetted on 1st January will have been awarded for continuous courage over a period of time, rather than a single specific act of bravery, This takes nothing away from Alfred's earning of the award; the war diary speaks to the difficulty and danger of what was asked of him, and the magnificent job he made of it. 
Alfred’s Military Cross was handed to his father, George, by General Sir Francis Lloyd at a ceremony in the General Meeting Room at Paddington Station on Saturday, 23rd of February 1918. 
“Sir Francis pinned Military Medals to the breasts of seven Great Western men, whose conspicous gallantry and devotion to duty on the battlefield had won them these honours. Another Great Western man was congratulated upon having won the Distinguish Conduct Medal and to Mr George Boxall, the Company’s late chief cashier, was handed the Military Cross awarded to his son, who had been killed in action. The awards were to members of the G.W.R. Engineering Department attached to the 262nd (G.W.R.) Company, Royal Engineers. Sir Francis said that the men to whom the decorations were given belonged to a company that had done great work at the Front, almost in the firing lines at times, and under shell fire; and were part of a great railway company in this country that had had a large share in the war”

He was a platoon sergeant from June 1915 to May 1917. He arrived in Le Havre on 26 January 1917 and kept a daily diary of the combat, but on 17 May 1917 went over the top. Fighting was fierce with many casualties and on 18 May was wounded by a ""whizz-bang"" in the back and head. He wrote to his parents on 20th May assuring his parents he was well and not severely injured, though having a shrapnel wound to his back. On the 24 May he was sent back to England and had surgery on 1st June at a hospital in Bristol to remove the shrapnel from near his spine.

118242,en,"Jack (John William Harry Beechey - Service no. K/16587 (PO)) was the eldest son of William Henry and Anne Beechey (nee Appleby) of 39 South View, Grove Street, Wantage.  Jack was born in Windsor, Berkshire, and on leaving school became a milkman.  He joined the Royal Navy in 1912, when he was just 18 years old, as a second-class stoker - but was promoted to first class stoker in October 1913.  His service record shows that he served on various ships including Victory II, Iron Duke, Renown, Edgar, Queen Mary, Europa and the Hampshire.  The Europa was a ship that serviced other ships stationed around the world, acting as a sort of shuttle ship.  The Europa had previously taken a new crew for the Hampshire out to the Far East and brought the old crew back to the UK.  

Jack was 22 when he joined the ill-fated voyage of HMS Hampshire in June 1916 which had Lord Kitchener on board.  The family believe HMS Hampshire was previously at the Battle of Jutland where it received light damage after it rammed and sank a U-boat.  The ship returned to Scapa Flow, east of the Orkney Islands.  Fred Foxton, the Electrical Artificer on HMS Caroline, reported that the HMS Hampshire had returned to Scapa Flow from patrol on the morning on 5th June 1916 and that the servicemen were told to ‘sling their hammocks’.  However, the order was countermanded and they put to sea again with HMS Royalist and two screening destroyers.  HMS Hampshire left Scapa Flow with Lord Kitchener on board and the family say that the rumour was that they were going to Russia to rescue the Tsar.  The Hampshire went westward of the Orkney and Shetland Islands while HMS Caroline and the Royalist went eastwards of the islands with their destroyers.  The weather conditions at the time were atrocious and the accompanying destroyers were sent back to the harbour because the seas were so rough.

The telegraphist on HMS Caroline went on watch at midnight and reported that he could hear the HMS Iron Duke calling and continuing to call the HMS Hampshire with no response.  The theory at the time was that the captain of the Hampshire had stayed inshore of the islands to keep out of the worst of the weather but unfortunately ran into the German mines.  It was suspected that the U-boat that had laid the mines was one that had been attacked some time earlier by British destroyers.  

According to official records, 643 men are listed as having lost their lives but others have speculated that the real number is probably more like 700 men.  Having read the accounts of the sinking, the family believe that, as a stoker, their Uncle Jack would have had an horrific death, trapped below decks and surrounded by scalding steam and fire, with no chance of escaping.  

Jack was a simple country lad, unsophisticated with a limited education from a hard-working family.  His letters home to his mother were affectionate and loyal.  In them he pledges to give his wages to his mother, often promising to send three-quarters of his wages at a time.  

Doris’s daughter Phyllis recalls that her first awareness of Jack was of a ‘picture with writing on it’ in her grandma’s house.  When Phyllis asked her why she had this on the wall her grandma told her to read it and see what it said.  It was a commemorative scroll with Jack’s details on it honouring his sacrifice.  She told Phyllis that Jack was her eldest son.  

The night before he left for service on HMS Hampshire Jack told his younger sister Doris, who was only five at the time, that he would like to bring her a little present back and asked her what she would like.  She replied that all she wanted was for him to come home safely.  He consulted his mother who thought that Doris would dearly like a little watch.  Later, Jack’s mother bought Doris a watch in memory of her big brother.  Jack had previously given Doris a gold cross and chain.  Doris was scared to lose it and kept it in a box, but her daughter Phyllis is proud to wear this gift from her Uncle Jack.

The family say that on the night of 5th June 1916 Jack’s mother heard a thud and although she checked throughout the house she couldn’t find a reason for it. She later associated the thud with the explosion of the mine and the loss of the Hampshire and also firmly believed that she had heard Jack calling her.  Phyllis recalls her grandmother as always being sad and believes she never got over the loss of her eldest son.

Jack died helping to defend his country in the ‘war to end all wars’.  To others he is a number on a casualty list but to his family he is a hero."

He joined 2nd Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire & Derbyshire Regiment) as a machine gunner, in March 1915 (army number 18260). He fought and died in Battle of the Somme, in the attack near Guillemont, September 15, 1916, aged 25.

A letter was sent to his mother on 22nd August 1917, saying that it was assumed he had been killed in action on September 15, 1916, or later. More official correspondence ensued, and finally a pocket book with his last letter to his mother was found on his body and returned to the family (some time after November 1917). It contained the last letter to his mother, written while lying mortally wounded in a shell hole at the Somme. The story has been used in Peter Barton's book, The Somme. John Duesbery has no known grave, and he is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial to the missing.

My Great Uncle Jim emmigrated to Canada in 1911 aged 18 years, and worked on the railways. He was originally from Blackrock, Co. Louth, Ireland.  He joined the Canadian Army in 1916 and trained in Camp Hughes in Canada.  He was sent on the 'Olympic' to England in 1916 and trained/remained in Whitley and Seaford camps.  There was a rubella quarantine so he did not go to France until 1917.  He was sent to dig tunnels in Vimy Ridge. He then joined the 8th Battalion Royal Winnipeg Rifles Regiment.  In the Battle of Arleux in April 1917 he was wounded in the shoulder by a sniper's bullet.  He was wounded again by shrapnel in the right arm in the Battle of Hill 70 on the Western Front in August 1917.  He was hospitalized for several weeks.  He returned in October 1917 to his Battalion and was preparing to go North.  His letters stop at the end of October and it is believed he was killed on 10th November.  His body was never found.  It is believed he was killed by artillery (there were statements by another soldier to the Red Cross re same).

My Great Uncle Fip was also from Blackrock, Co. Louth, Ireland.  He was a doctor by profession and trained in Dublin.  He served in St. Vincents, The Coombe and Camberwell Infirmary in England.  Initially he was refused admission into the army due to heart problems, but he managed to enlist in 1917 as Captain.  He was sent to Egypt, Palestinian Front.  He travelled on the S.S. Transylvania from Marseille which was torpedoed by a German sub.  He survived – many died – and was brought to Savona, Italy.  He wrote home to describe the incident.  He came from a very catholic family and believed that his wearing of the green scapula at the time saved his life.  He served in the 3rd General Hospital from June 1917 to mid-1919.  He was then demobbed and sent home.  Alongside dealing with the wounded from the Front he also cared for people with Spanish Flu.  He returned to Norwich, England and continued to practice as a doctor.  He returned to Co. Louth in Ireland in the 1960’s.

Sam and Ernie had diabetes and didn&#039;t go to the war, and my father, born in 1904, was too young to serve. Bill joined a horse regiment during the war. He was gassed but survived and he survived the war, too. Joe was born on 7 July 1893. During the war he served in the Army Corps of Cyclists, 36th Division attached to the 10th Corps Cyclist Battalion. Joe was at the Somme, Ypres and we think in Flanders, too. He used to visit my family every Christmas but although I was interested in the war, Joe would never talk about it. However, Joe did an interview for the Irish Times newspaper in July 1976 for the 60th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme and shared his memories: &quot;I don&#039;t know whether I was afraid. You couldn&#039;t have time then to think or to have nerves. Our nerves was gone, sure, by that time. We were on ordinary push bikes, bikes you&#039;d see in the street, you know. Our jobs were different: sometimes to go ahead and report on the German&#039;s movements and sometimes going behind the lines or then maybe carrying ammunition. We were meant to work together with the cavalry, them in the fields and us on the road. But there wasn&#039;t much cavalry at the Somme, I think, I can&#039;t remember all that much, I was only in my 20s…But I do remember that when the fighting started you couldn&#039;t be worried about fear or anything. The place was full of machine guns, rockets, hand bombs and terrible noise. Explosions going off all the time. I know we went over the top in a three-way move, one on the right, the 36th in the middle, and one on the left. How did I survive? I was one of the lucky ones that got through, that&#039;s all. My number mustn&#039;t have been up…The weather was melting, like now it was. And they couldn&#039;t get food to us, only our emergency rations. Terrible stuff: a tin of bully beef and a few hard biscuits.&quot; Joe was severely gassed in 1917 but he survived and was in France the day the war ended. &quot;All I remember is hearing the command to cease fire…and then the cafes and the pubs opened and we got some free beer.&quot; Joe worked in Clery&#039;s in Dublin once he had recovered from the war and spent over forty years as an employee there. He died in 1978 and is buried in St Munn&#039;s graveyard, Taghmon."

According to his Canadian Expeditionary Force Certificate, he served in Canada, England and France, with the 15th Brigade Ammunition Column, 60th Battery Canadian Field Artillery, and 1st Battery, Canadian Garrison Artillery. He was awarded the Military Cross for ""exceptionally fine work and devotion to duty while observing during the fighting at Passchendaele, carrying out observations for four consecutive nights and days under very heavy shell fire and the most trying conditions"" and was also mentioned in Despatches. He was demobilised in 1919, and was later awarded an Honorary Degree of MSc by the National University of Ireland, in recognition of his war time record and Military Cross. He joined the British Colonial Service, and was an engineer in the Malay States, coming home in 1941 due to ill health.

The family archive is extraordinary, consisting of newspaper cuttings, letters, postcards and photographs. The striking thing about the correspondence is the sense of really being able to know Fred. He comes across as a kind, funny young man who loved his family very much, especially his sister Sarah. He remained a central part of family life even from the trenches and family happenings were as important to him as what was happening in the war. In one letter he wrote to thank his parents for the food parcels that they had been sending and to say how much he enjoyed having a salmon tea. However, he also asked them to stop sending them as he knew how expensive it was and he preferred that they spend the money on the household back home."
105452,en,"Apprentice steam engine maker, George Stanley Peachment volunteered for the army in April 1915 and became a Rifleman (Private) in the 2nd Battalion, The King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC).  It should be noted that this brave young volunteer signed with a false date of birth as he died aged 18, British Army Regulations stated that to serve overseas a man must be 19 years or over. 

Manpower shortages at this period of the war meant that training was perfunctory in practice and very short in time, illustrated by the fact that the 18 year old Rifleman Peachment was in action on the first day of the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915, some short 20 weeks later.  He was with the 2nd KRRC south of the Vermelles to Hulluch road when, during very heavy fighting, the British front line was nearly overwhelmed by the German forces and forced to retire, in the military spin of the time 'in order to reorganise' - when infact their Division's attack had been stopped by uncut barbed wire and gassed by their own side, then expelled from ground earlier won at great cost by German counter attacks. During this 'retirement' Private Peachment saw his company commander, Captain G.R. Dubs lying wounded, and bravely, seemingly without thought of his own safety crawled to help him. The enemy fire was intense and, although there was a shell-hole quite close in which a few men had taken cover, Private Peachment apparently, by his actions, did not place his own safety above that of a man to whom he must have felt great loyalty. He knelt in the open by this officer and tried to help him, but while doing so was first wounded in the chest by a grenade ('bomb').  This did not end his selfless acts as he now, amazingly, began to drag Dubs to a place of safety.  However, sadly, in a very short time George Peachement was then mortally wounded by small arms (rifle or M.G.) fire. He was posthumously awarded the V.C. for bravery but his body was never recovered and his name has been carved into the 'Memorial to the Missing' at 'Dud Corner' CWGC Cemetery, Loos. The attached account of his actions was written by James Price Lloyd of the Welsh Regiment, who served with Military Intelligence. After the war, the government to destroyed all the archives relating to this propaganda (section MI 7b (1)). They were regarded as being too sensitive to risk being made public. Remarkably these documents have survived in the personal records of Captain Lloyd. Many of these papers are officially stamped, and one can trace the development of many individual articles from the notes based on an idea, to the pencil draft which is then followed by the hand-written submission and the typescript. The archive ""Tales of the VC"" comprises 94 individual accounts of the heroism that earned the highest award for valour, the Victoria Cross. These are recounted deferentially and economically, yet they still manage to move the reader.

My grandmother, Ada Marie Flynn (1893-1981), of Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland and Greenore, Co Louth, served as a munitions worker during the war, as attested to by her “On War Service” triangular badge. Her brother,  Oweson Flynn (born 1896), served as an officer in the 5th Bn., The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment. Ada’s sister, Vi (born 1897), married Charles Joseph Mackay, an officer in the 5th Bn., The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment. During the war he transferred to the RFC (Royal Flying Corps). He was awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and Croix de Guerre. In addition to her own munitions work, Ada corresponded with an Irishman she barely knew, a prisoner of war in Germany. Ada's sister Sheila married John Donal Carroll, MC (1917) Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and later Colonel in the Irish Free State Army Medical Service (1921-1925). He died in 1928 aged 38.


My grandfather, Captain James Cecil Joseph Corballis (1891-1947), came from the Corballis family of Co Meath. He was the eldest son of Captain James Frederick Joseph Corballis of Ratoath Manor, Ratoath, Co Meath, himself a veteran of the Boer War who became a recruiting officer for the British Army during the War. James was affectionately known as ‘Tommy’, and became an officer in the 5th Bn., The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment. He served in France. ‘Tommy’ and Ada married in  January 1918.

Tommy’s brother, Richard Arthur (1893-1921) became an officer in the 3rd Bn. The Dorsetshire Regiment. He was severely wounded on 25th April 1915 at Hill 60. He died of his wounds in Penzance in March 1921.

Another of Tommy's brothers, Basil Joseph (1896-1966), became an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry. While seconded to the MGC (Machine Gun Corps) he was awarded the Military Cross on the first day of the battle of the Somme, 1st July 1916. Tommy’s sister, Barbara Marie (1892-1967) served with the VAD (Voluntary Aid Detachment) in England. She married Brigadier William Moxhay Sutton, DSO MC.

Tommy’s aunt (sister of the afore-mentioned Captain James Frederick Joseph Corballis),  May (Emily Mary) (1873-1940), joined the nursing Order of Saint Vincent de Paul as a Sister of Charity. The name she took was Soeur Marguerite. At the outbreak of the Great War she was attached to a hospital in Monaco. She was sent to run the frontline Hospital of Saint Louis in Roubaix, occupied France, to nurse wounded French, English and German soldiers. Having been arrested by the Germans allegedly for spying, she was imprisoned in Rastatt, Germany. She wrote to the Kaiser to demand her release. Her plea was successful and she returned to nursing for the remainder of the War, mainly at Souilly. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the SBM Red Cross medal and finally, in 1927, the Legion d’Honneur in Strasbourg in which City a street was named in her honour.

117035,en,"Before the war John Breed worked in a mill in Leeds that made flags and banners. This was the family mill (E.Riley and Co Ltd, Marsh Lane, Leeds.) His address was 4 Methley Mount, Chapeltown, Leeds. 
According to his war diary, John Bennington Breed arrived in Le Havre on 30th January 1917 with the Royal Garrison Artillery, 236th Siege Battery. He kept a daily diary of his experiences, including on every page how many shells were fired every day as he was in charge of armaments.
He talks about the gas and the planes and airships going over and talks about shooting them down. He was killed on 31st July 1917 - after he had made a last entry in his diary at around 9pm. He was 35 when he was killed. 
He is presumed to have joined earlier due to his age. It is likely that he enrolled around 1915 as his training diary is dated 1915-16 and includes lots of drawings of guns, ammunitions and instructions for firing distances.
He was a Second Lieutenant when he died. A memorial service was held in York on the 12th November, 1921 at Elmfield College York. 
A memorial card shows that he was buried in Klein Vierstarrt Cemetery, South West of Ypres. He left three children of which the contributor&#039;s mother was the middle one, aged seven when he died.

The diary makes sad reading due to the references to people getting killed and gassed. Occasionally he got a weekend off in a local town for rest and recouperation. In one exert the general tells them off for shooting when he was passing on his horse and he intends to report them. John Breed wrote that he would tell someone first. There is a great deal in the diary about conditions in the trenches over the 6 month period near Ypres on the Western Front."

We wrote to somebody in the War Office and find out more about James. So he looked it up but he didn’t find out a lot but I’ve brought all those papers with me.

It says in the papers that James joined up in Manchester, I think it was in 1915. He was told that his name would be taken down and then he was called up in 1916. It was part of a scheme to get people to join up. My dad was fighting (GPO) when James was training. My dad was then sent to jail in England and I don’t think they ever managed to get in touch with one another. Because my father would have been very much on the republican side, I think that he would have been horrified that James would have joined the British Army. 
I did actually go to the Somme and I did find his name. He didn’t have a grave but his name was on a monument. I had written to the Wargraves Commission and they told me where I might find it. I found it very, very easily which was great."

      This Code had been invented by a Mr Morse, and was used officially for sending messages until about 1996.  At the time it was a very advanced technique, and John must have been very proud of his prowess.
      Another draft leave was granted before the day arrived to march behind the band to Oswestry Station bound for an unknown destination.  Would it be the battlefields of Belgium where so many of his fellow countrymen had died?   They arrived at Southampton and boarded a paddle steamer for France.  They arrived at La Harve and stayed there for two or three days.  Then they were put in to luggage trucks to cross France to Marseilles. They sighed a sigh of relief when they realised they were not going to the Western Front.  But where were they going?   Pugh developed measles and had to stay in hospital in France, but John was marched onto an Ex German boat called the Hunsspil, and it sailed eastward along the Mediterranean.   One night it collided with another ship, and had to be towed into Malta harbour for repairs which took a week to complete.  It then sailed into Milo harbour for a short spell before travelling westward via several islands to their final destination - Salonika in Greece.  The journey had taken about a month, and although John was very sea sick in the English Channel he was not sick again. However the journey across France was very miserable; packed into the luggage vans the men had great difficulty lying down to sleep.
 The Forgotten Army in Salonika.    
         When the party reached Salonika they were marched up country to a canvas camp called Summer Hill. The 11th R.W.F. Commanding Officer was Lt. Col. Yateman; and Gen. Duncan was in Charge of the 22nd Division. Whilst there they experienced a severe blizzard and the snow, ice, frost and wind broke tent ropes on many of the tents.  The Severn Valley seemed a long way away!
          A few days later, John and his pals were marched several miles to the Front Line to fight the Bulgarians.  It was trench warfare; our trenches on hills much smaller than the enemy’s.  The allied fronts were called Vardar, Struma and Doiran respectively; and John was positioned on the Dorain front - Doiran Lake lay before him to the right, and the enemy lines on the Grande Courone were directly in front.
           For a time John was in the front line manning the trenches. At night, he repaired the barbed wire entanglements which had been damaged by enemy shells. In addition to the shells and bullets there were rats, lice and mosquitoes to contend with! Later he was attached to the Company’s signal section.  The men would go out in pairs to man a mud hut in the front line.  The Company did a fortnight in the line and a fortnight behind the lines. 
           In Mid Summer 1918 John became ill, and when the time to change over came he requested permission to accompany those leaving in advance of the main unit.  It was a long walk, and the illness became worse during training behind the lines. He felt neglected as malaria and dysentery gradually took over, and he became unconscious before reaching the Australian Base Hospital in Northern Greece!  After hospital treatment - mainly quinine – he recovered, but dysentery left him with a damaged bowel. For that, and the after effects of malaria he later received a small army pension. He rejoined his unit (11th Bat. R.W.F.) at Stavross on the South coast of Greece.  Later, the unit was shipped to Dedigatch, which was then on the South coast of Bulgaria.  The landing was by raft and swimming ashore; rations were scarce - water soaked biscuits were the only food.
           The plan was to march against the Turks, but before this could happen they surrendered – 30th Sept 1918. The unit was then marched many miles back to the Doiran Front in Greece, to do odd jobs and patrol the line. The Bulgarians had also surrendered.  During this time John said that he trusted the Bulgarians who were his enemies, more that the Greeks who were supposed to be allies! 
            John had been on this Front for about 12 months, when all units were moved by rail from Kilendare station to Constantinople, to become the Army of the Black Sea.  Fourteen officers and 317 other ranks were marched from Stanbul, over the Galita Bridge, to Tashkishla Barracks.   This was a large old military building made up of barracks surrounding a large parade square.   It was said that this place had housed prisoners during the war. The rooms were large and high, with 10ft square pillars supporting the ceiling.  The pillars had long cracks in them which by day were filled with bugs; these bugs were also in the beds and blankets!  The soldiers prized the bugs out of the pillars with their bayonets, and sprinkled them and the beds with Keeting powder every night before going to bed.   John spent his 21st Birthday in this hell hole!
         About quarter of a mile away, on the shores of the Bosphorus was the Sultan’s Palace.  John did guard duty here and also on Galeta Quay, A.D.A. Sigs., and the Garrison Cells.  Later on he was put in charge of the training of six signalers, and they operated on various buildings in the city, signaling to one another.
         Life was beginning to improve, (although it took years to get over the effects of malaria,) and when John came first in a regimental run he was sent for training to Bukdery on the Bospherous.  The area sports were held over the Bospherous in Asia Minor, but although the prize was a home posting John did not manage to win his race!
         Later the unit was moved to be under canvas in Asia Minor, on the shores of the Sea of Marmara.  The men were able to bathe here, and on one occasion John very nearly drowned; only managing to save himself by finding a jetty post which helped him reach the surface!
          In 1919, after a year in Turkey, and a total of two years abroad, John returned home. (His pal, Pugh, had contracted measles on the way out to Salonika, and never reached Turkey, he had ended up in Greece with the 11th R.W.F.)    He travelled by boat to S.France; crossed France by train to Calais and by ship to Dover. Eventually he arrived at Prees Heath railway station on his way to Oswestry for demob.   He changed trains, and then popped for a cup of tea.  The train pulled off without him, and away went all his kit and trophies which he had brought for his relatives and friends, never to be seen again. He was heart broken.   He was transferred to the Army Reserve on 13th Dec 1919, attached to the 7th South Wales Borderers, (before that he had been attached to the 2nd East Surreys.) He was finally released from service on 9th Jan 1920, having served for exactly three years, and eventually returned home to Llandinam. By then all the celebrations and parties linked with the Armistice of 11th November 1918 were over. It was not until March 11th 1925 that the people of Llandinam showed their appreciation of his war service by presenting him with testimonial which read:-
         “To L/Cpl J. Jones of the Parish of Llandinam by his fellow parishioners as a slight tribute of their great admiration and deepest gratitude for the courage and devotion displayed by him in serving his King and Country in the Great War 1914 – 1919”.
	Unemployment was rampant. He was given a weekly pension of 8/- for 12 months, and 5/- for 6 months.  Desperately, he had to start looking for a job, but most of them had been taken by the soldiers who had returned earlier!  Eventually, he was lucky to get a job as green house gardener at Bronwylfa Hall, Wrexham, working for Sir Edmund Bushby.      After working there was about a week he was told he had been appointed as a constable with the Flintshire Constabulary.  He gave in his notice to the head gardener, and returned home before reporting for duty at Mold police station on Apl 1st 1920! He served in the Flintshire force until his retirement in 1953."

His Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) was held up by heavy rifle fire and all his officers had become casualties. This caused the usual confusion and for want of leadership the attack was flagging when Private Ryder, acting alone and with great bravery advanced at a quick pace towards the German held trench. Not only did he suppress the occupants but also, by the skillful handling of his Lewis Gun succeeded in clearing the trench - his success seems to have encouraged his companions making the subsequent advance possible and turned what could have been failure into an advance.

Both enlisted in September 1915. Neither were married and Peter had worked as a bank official prior to enlistment. 
Peter (known as Leo) was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment attached to the 3rd battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. He received officer training in London and was sent to France in November 1916.   His letters home from France describe playing sport behind the lines and how used he has become to the sound of the guns at nighttime. He describes the fun of the Brigades sports day during their period of rest and the 'extremely good music', remarking wryly that 'most people here thought on yesterday afternoon that this was a very fine war'. The awareness of danger was however ever present and he mentions how glad he is that there is a Catholic chaplain with them to provide services before going into danger. In April 1917 he was hospitalized for scabies and was due to be sent home but the hospital ships were cancelled and he remained in France. A month later Peter was dead. He was killed at the Battle of the Arras on the 19th May 1917 on the Western Front. He was aged twenty-eight. His final letter, collected here, was dated 13th May 1917, less than a week before his death, making it particularly poignant, especially his closing promise to write again at the first opportunity. Peter is commemorated on the Arras memorial in France. 

His brother Christopher served with the Royal Flying Corps during the war. He enlisted at the age of twenty-one. He was based in France during the war, and his letter in this collection is written to his brother Jim who was back in Ireland. His letter suggests he missed home, evident by his desire for ‘all the local news’. Peter and Christopher were located less than 40 miles apart in France in May 1917 and had made plans to meet just before Peter's death. After the war Christopher left Ireland and moved to Rhodesia where he joined the police force. He did not return to Ireland except for a brief visit in 1939. 

The war story of Peter and Christopher was passed down through the family and his relatives found Peter's photograph a few years ago, making the story more real to them. They were recently invited to a ceremony at the Arras memorial in France."

Pollard had volunteered for service on August 8, 1914. Up to that date, he had worked as a clerk at an insurance company. He was wounded twice earlier in his service and showed exceptional courage in returning to his unit after recovering from wounds. His bravery earned him the highest (and largest number of) awards awarded to a soldier in his unit during the war.
He had entered the war as a Private, but was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, Honourable Artillery Company, British Army during the First World War when the deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. Citation:
On 29 April 1917 at Gavrelle, France, the troops of various units had become disorganized owing to the heavy casualties from shell fire and a subsequent determined attack with very strong forces caused further confusion and retirement. Second Lieutenant Pollard realized the seriousness of the situation and with only four men he started a counter-attack with bombs, pressing it home until he had broken the enemy attack and regained all that had been lost and much ground in addition. This officer's splendid example inspired courage into every man who saw him.

104487,en,"Some years ago my parents died and after my father’s death I cleared his house, put it up for sale and gathered together box after box of family photographs, old newspaper cuttings, letters and the like. For the past 5 or 6 years they have lain jumbled up in a wardrobe in our spare room and my task for the next few months is to sort them out. I’ve looked at them many times and marvelled at the social history there is – many of the photographs and objects dating back a century. There are also faded photographs of days out I can remember as a child or people who I do not know, sitting on beaches or gazing into the camera.

Of all the items, however, there are a number relating to my grandfather, Joe, which I find poignant and exciting. He died in 1953 when I was eight and I only have vague memories of him. I don’t have any great emotional feelings about the items I’m just interested and moved by the social history they display.

I grew up in Preston in Lancashire and lived, until I came to Nottingham (to teacher training college) aged about twenty, in a two up two down terraced house. It was a very humble background. My grandfather, Joseph Derbyshire, lived in  a similar house in the next street. He had lived there all his life from when he married in the early years of the century. He spent most of his working life as journeyman property repairer  and builder – never owning his own business and always, I think being strapped for cash. Like many others of his generation he was, of course, a victim of the great depression of the 30s and lived through two wars. Additionally, his wife, my grandmother,  died in childbirth in the early 30s and he struggled to bring up 5 small children – one of them my mother. All this I knew. But when I began rummaging through the boxes I found one or two items that immediately brought a link with him.

So, what did I find. Well, there were numerous postcards each with a little popular verse  - I’ve seen their like before on the &#039;Antiques Roadshow&#039; - but these were personal they were from my grandfather to my grandmother and vice versa. They were written during the Great War when  he was in France &#039;doing his bit.&#039; They are brief but poignant. They mention &#039;little Albert&#039; – the oldest of his children – just starting to walk, they tell of Janey thinking of her husband every night and praying for his safety and wondering if he has a bed to sleep on. They tell of him &#039;coming home soon on leave&#039;. Many of his have no message apart from &#039;To my dear Janey&#039;  - I understand that serving soldiers were often not allowed to write messages in case it gave anything away to the enemy so Janey had to simply look at the picture and at least know that he was still alive.

As I looked at them I reflected upon how different things are today – e-mail, mobile phones and the like – and indeed society’s expectations would not tolerate such a position. But in those days families just accepted this and kept a stiff upper lip. I thought, too, about what it must have meant to Joe and Janey (and millions like them) when he went off to France – a place which to them must have seemed as far away as the moon is to us. A completely unknown world for ordinary people who rarely travelled from their home town.

Also in the box were many faded sepia photographs of Joe with Janey and his brothers  - all standing proudly posing in their uniforms – ready to march off to war or return to the battle field after leave. There were other photographs too – showing Joe standing with his comrades – all to attention in their camp  at the front. And with these were pictures of him sitting with nurses and other wounded soldiers. And finally a lovely sketch of a rather grand building and scribbled on the back &#039;the hospital where I was treated for my wounds&#039;. My grandfather was always a quite a good drawer - I can remember as small  boy sitting drawing with him.

But the things that pulled all these together and have given me much food for thought were two handwritten letters. One is a page obviously torn from an exercise book and written in green ink – in a beautiful copperplate hand. The other is an exact copy – dated the day afterwards (March 26th 1919). The first letter is a draft and has some  blanks where he has left  spaces  to put in bits of factual information – his army number, a date etc. The second is a final copy which  he obviously copied out the day afterwards. Presumably, there must have been a third copy which he sent. The letter is a begging letter – a plea from a desperate man to the war commissioners in Chelsea for an increase in his war pension so that he can support his family. His pension had been granted at the beginning of March and he was writing at the end of March so he was obviously anxious to improve his award - perhaps they were desperate for food, perhaps the workhouse beckoned. I say that it is an exact copy. This is not strictly true. The first draft says that his wife - Janey - is suffering from a &#039;nervous breakdown&#039; but by the time that he does the copy on the following day he has changed this to a &#039;serious illness&#039; and he says &#039;she is not strong&#039;. For whatever reason he felt that it was not appropriate to use the term &#039;nervous breakdown&#039; - I wonder why? Stigma? &#039;Serious illness&#039; sounds more dramatic? Perhaps Janey didn&#039;t want to admit her condition. In the end it doesn&#039;t really matter but I can understand his anxiety. 

I have to confess, that although I have no great emotional bond with my grandfather or indeed my family as a whole, whenever I read the letter I get a lump in my throat. He was a very ordinary man of little schooling. By trade a journeyman whitesmith (a worker in tin and pewter). He lived in a tiny house with no hot water or bathroom. He had a beautiful handwriting style and his use of English was impeccable. He was sent off to a far off country to fight in a war that was not of his making, was wounded on two occasions and returned to his country not as a hero (except perhaps to his wife and his neighbours) but had to beg for more money from the government because the injuries he had sustained meant, as he says, that &#039;I shall be handicapped while ever I live.&#039;

So, what did the letter say? (I copy exactly as he wrote):

Gentlemen,
I  Joseph Derbyshire of 5 Rigby Street, Preston, Lancashire most humbly petition you to review my pension of eight shillings and threepence (8/3)per week granted to me on the 7/3/19 for twelve months, for the wounds which I received in action during the war.

I don&#039;t think this amount satisfactory and I think that you will agree with me when I tell you that I have a Wife (who is suffering from a serious illness and she is not strong) and a Child who is three years old depending on me and I cannot yet follow any employment and particularly my own trade that of a journeyman Black and White smith nor do I think I shall ever be able to do the same at my work as I did before the war.

My Regimental address was 23807 Pte. Joseph Derbyshire, 9th Batt. Loyal North Lancs Regt. and I was wounded through the chest and lungs on the 21st Oct.  1916 and I was in Hospital six months  before I recovered. Shortly after this I was suffering from dysentery and had to be sent home on the 12th Sept. 1917 to recuperate. I was again wounded on the 27th May 1918 and taken prisoner with a broken leg. Through some cause or other this leg is now shorter that the other and as my work demands me to be on my feet most of the time I shall be handicapped while ever I live.

Hoping this will receive your best attention .
I remain,
Yours humbly
Joseph Derbyshire

As I read the letter I pictured him in my mind’s eye sitting, all those years ago, carefully scribing his letter. I remembered that he died at 61 – a remarkably young age and I always remember him looking an old man. Indeed I have a photo of him sitting on his back door step with me – it must have been shortly before he died. He looked far older than his 60 years. He had had a very hard life. And I wonder what it must have &#039;cost&#039; him – to write a begging letter. Today we would not tolerate a pension for war wounds that was only for 12 months. Today our expectations would quite rightly be so different. Would I have written such a humble, polite letter - I think not! (although I sense in it a bit of  &#039;steel&#039; when he uses phrases like &#039;I think that you will agree with me&#039;). I also remember that he always walked with a pronounced limp – perhaps a left over from his broken leg.


And as I read the pages and looked at the creased  sepia photographs, I thought too how my grandfather could never in his wildest dreams have imagined that night in March 1919 when he sat down to write his letter that almost a hundred years later his grandson would take his scribbling which have somehow survived the years and the photos of him standing proudly in his uniform and scan them into a computer (what would he have made of that!). And then &#039;publish&#039; his words on something called the internet so that they could be instantly read by everyone on the planet – should they choose to look. What a very long way we have come with our technology – but  our leaders still send young men off to war and then wring their hands when a young soldier is killed. Our morals and ethics lag far behind our technology.

But, personal prejudices aside, in sorting out my box I felt that I had somehow fleetingly touched the past."
104433,en,"My grandncle William ""Bill"" McNamara was born on 15 October, 1895 in Loughinstown, Fedamore, Co. Limerick, Ireland. He emigrated to the United States at a young age (perhaps in his late teens). His enlistment record cites ""porter"" as his occupation. He lived in Brooklyn. He enlisted aged 22 as a Private in the 77th Division on 27 February, 1918 (LS No. 63, Brooklyn). He was in Co. ""B"", 305.

He was sent to France. His diary mentions Verdun. He received a Purple Heart medal. His records state that he received a ""slight"" gunshot wound to his right thigh. 

His diary contains some poems he wrote. It says that he got the diary from a French soldier at the start. There is some writing in French (e.g. notes on formations), some reminiscences about home and some descriptions of his days. 

After the war he returned to Brooklyn but I am not sure of his occupation after the war.

117098,en,"John Henry Fisher was conscripted at the age of 37 to the 13th Infantry Labour Corps of the Lincolnshire Regiment. He was married with two children, Jack and Gladys and was employed as a clerk at Tetley&#039;s Brewery in Leeds.

Within two weeks of being called up in March 1917 he was in France working behind the Front Line in the Arras area. His job was to ensure equipment and resources got to the soldiers who were fighting on the Front Line. This included loading shells in to cases which were then loaded on to wagons to be taken to the Front Line, and then unloading the wagons on their return. He was engaged in much dangerous work including the testing of gas masks. Whilst working here he witnessed the Canadians taking Vimy Ridge and saw German prisoners being marched back through his village. 

In September 1917 he was moved to the Ypres area of Flanders and was now attached to the Royal Artillery Garrison. Work continued to supply the Front Line with equipment under the constant shelling from &quot;Fritz&quot;. He also worked on digging trenches, laying barbed wire, concreting dug outs, clearing the Menin Road and working on the light railway at Sanctuary Wood. He had some narrow escapes and was invalided twice to hospital: once with dysentery and secondly with an injured hand which resulted in him being sent back home on sick leave. 

Even on Armistice Day he was out working building a railway bridge and dangerous work continued digging up mines the Germans had laid under the railway lines during their retreat.

The men who served in the Labour Corps did essential logistic work during the war and yet are very much overlooked and forgotten. They served unarmed and frequently within the range of the German guns undertaking a wide range of menial, hard and dangerous tasks. They experienced the same sights and sounds of the fighting soldiers and I believe it is important to tell the stories of their experiences so we may appreciate the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; activities during the Great War and give these men the recognition and thanks they so rightly deserve.

John Henry Fisher was my Great GrandFather. I was always led to believe that no one in my family had fought in World War 1 and yet this diary reveals that although he did not fight he was certainly there and very much involved in the hell of Flanders of 1917 - 1918."

119459,en,"This is the story of my great uncle, Cecil Duncan-Jones. He was born in 1883 and was originally from London. Unlike his elder brother, he did not attend university but pursued a life as an actor, poet and novelist. He was tall, dark and handsome and although he struggled a little for money, he loved acting and had played the Duke of Orleans in Henry V.

In 1914 he was in Alsace Lorraine recovering from an operation when the war broke out. He was among many British nationals caught out by the start of the war and was taken, along with 600 others, to a camp at Ruhleben near Berlin. During his captivity, he continued to adapt and put on plays, he also wrote a volume of poetry entitled 'In Captivity'.
By the spring of 1918, he was still in the internment camp but his health was deteriorating due to malnourishment. He was therefore discharged and allowed to travel to Holland (near the Hague), hoping to get to England on an ambulance convoy.
A letter to his aunt Millie (on his mother's side) written on 15th October 1918 described living in hotels as it was more economical and his dramatic interests keeping his spirits up. By this time, his health had deteriorated further and his gums were bleeding. He managed to leave Holland on the last ambulance ship but he was very ill and he died, soon after his return, on 10th November 1918."

He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps early in the war. The year of enlistment was most likely 1914 as he had a 1914 Christmas box. However, he later wrote in a poem that he joined 1915. He was a stretcher bearer in the Medical Corps and his primary reason for signing up was for travel and adventure.  He was stationed on Lemnos before being sent to Gallipoli, then evacuated from Gallipoli to Egypt and from there to Salonika for the remainder of the war. 

While working in a hospital during the war, a Serbian soldier gave Malachy a Balkans War Medal, which he kept and is now part of the collection. The family suspect he was given this as a 'thank you' gift from the soldier. Towards the end of the war, my grandfather contracted Malaria and while he was a patient in hospital the war ended. He left the Army Medical Corps when the war ended and returned to his job as a tailor (and worked with his father who was also a tailor). While he rarely spoke about the war for many decades, he wrote a very extensive and detailed poem about his time in Europe which he titled 'Dog Biscuits and Bully'. This was the first account he provided. He died in 1973."

He was 19 years old, and a Private in the 1st Battalion, The King's (Liverpool) Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 April 1918 near Boisieux St. Marc, France, it was necessary for information to be obtained from the front line and the only way to get it was over ground with no cover and in full view of the enemy. A small party tried without success, followed by six men, singly, each one being killed in the attempt. Private Counter then volunteered and, going out under terrific fire, got through and returned with vital information which enabled his commanding officer to organise and launch the final successful counter-attack. Subsequently he also carried five messages across the open under heavy artillery barrage to company headquarters.

His medal is on display at the Jersey Museum, Saint Helier. The attached account of his actions was written by James Price Lloyd of the Welsh Regiment, who served with Military Intelligence. After the war, the government to destroyed all the archives relating to this propaganda (section MI 7b (1)). They were regarded as being too sensitive to risk being made public.

117064,en,"This story relates to the contributor's father, Thomas William Arthur Smart, always known as William or Will. He was born on October 11th, 1891 in Wigston near Leicester. It is not known exactly when he joined up, but he was certainly in the Army in 1916, as the contributor has a postcard with this date on it. It is known from the contributor's mother that William was vaccinated against small pox and had a bad reaction to it.  He contracted peritonitis and was seriously ill, which delayed him going to the Front. In 1917 he had double pneumonia, sent to Rugeley Camp Military Hospital, and he was so ill that they sent for his sister, as they did not think that he would live. The contributor's mother said the fact that he was in a military hospital saved him, because he had 24 hour care. He was told that he didn't have to go to the Front and could have an office job instead, but he insisted that he wanted to go.

He went to the Front in 1918, reaching Boulogne on March 7th, 1918. He was in the Lincoln Regiment, Private W Smart, service number 43446. He had previously been in the South Staffordshire Regiment, but the contributor has a diary, in which he recorded his daily experiences, and on 7th March he records that he was drafted to the Lincolns. He then moved to the Front, and records his journey and subsequent experiences. 

On the 14th April he moved up to the line and took over some hastily dug trenches from another company. They were told that ""Jerry"" was a mile away. He wrote and later talked about being surrounded under fire. They were captured on the 15th or 16th and then marched to Armentières. Their eventual destination was a French barracks in Lille.  They were hungry and thirsty and had their pocket knives taken away. He records, sending a POW card to Lily, his sister, on 17th April, that there were 353 men all crowded into a small room, 20' x 50', with awful sanitary arrangements and alive with lice. His diary also records all kinds of details of what they had to eat, where they were moved to, the work they had to do, medical treatments, such as inoculations that he was given, female civilians being forced to work and so on. He also talks about stealing food when they were sent to work at a ration dump at the station. He was a prisoner for the rest of the war, in a variety of places in Belgium, and in October left for Bavaria. When the war finally ended he was in a camp at Hammelburg. On November 10th 1918 he notes that the ""Jerries"" were leaving the camp and heard about the general Armistice on the 12th. They remained at the camp and had a photograph taken in the village on 16th December. He travelled back to Switzerland, travelling through Germany on the 22nd December. He finally arrived home in England on 30th December on the ""Caledonian"" and back to his home near Leicester on 2nd January.

After the war he went back to his job in the Co-Operative offices in Wigston, Leicester. He married a Belgian girl, Helene Geens, in 1928, whom he had met on holiday. She had been a refugee in Prestatyn during the war; see story entitled: Belgian Refugees in North Wales."

His regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) commenced another attack against powerful German defences. Part of this advance was held up by machine gun fire during which time all the officers became casualties and, as happens on most like occasions because of such loss of leadership, confusion reigned and retirement, the usual course of action, would probably have occurred. However, Private Edwards, grasping the situation and on his own initiative dashed out towards the machine gun which he knocked out with his hand grenades. This very brave act, coupled with great presence of mind and total disregard of personal danger made further advance possible and cleared up a dangerous situation.

It is possible that, as an Irishman, his service in the British Army, like many others was not viewed with favour by the new Republic and consequently he seems to have settled in London.  However, later in life he was forced to sell his medal to make ends meet.

He embarked for France on the 26 October 1915 and joined the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards who had been serving in France and Flanders since their arrival on the 13 August 1914. The battalion that Private Whittam joined would have borne no resemblance to the original unit which had by now, suffered unimaginable casualties. Two years later, on the 31 July 1917 at Pilckem near Passchendaele, the opening day of the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31st July - 2nd August 1917) the 1st Coldsteam Guards formed part of the 2nd Brigade of the Guards Division. At 3.50 a.m. - zero hour, the brigade attacked the German forces at the so called &#039;Blue Line&#039;.  Initially the advance met little resistance,arriving at this position after only 15 minutes of fighting. At 5 a.m. the Brigade continued its advance to its second objective, the &#039;Black Line&#039;, which it captured by 6 a.m. The third objective, the &#039;Green Line&#039;, was attacked at 7.15 a.m.; but now came under heavy machine gun fire from the blockhouses/positions on the old Ypres - Staden railway line, which also began to affect the advance of the 38th Division on their right flank. A particular enemy machine gun was seen to be, by enfilade, holding up a considerable part of the attack and causing many casualties. Private Whitham, on his own initiative, immediately worked his way towards this position, from shell-hole to shell-hole, and through a British artillery barrage, until he reached the machine gun and although under very heavy fire captured it together with an officer and two other ranks. This very brave action was of great assistance to the battalion and undoubtedly saved many lives.

After the war he became a bricklayer, but times were hard, and he was rejected for other jobs by the Burnley Council even though he had served his King and Country and had won the VC. Consequently Thomas was forced to sell not only the medal but also a gold watch that had been presented by the same council (that now refused to employ him)in recognition of his bravery. Subsequently, both ended up in a pawn shop, but were retrieved by the same Authority. They now remain on display in the Towneley Hall Art Gallery &amp; Museums in Burnley. Shamefully, Thomas died in poverty aged only 36

104315,en,"My late paternal Grandmother exchanged a number of letters with her only brother Albert from when he volunteered in 1916 to his death in August 1917. My understanding is that he was on a gun emplacement that took a direct hit from an enemy shell. This in itself would have probably done for the crew but their own ordnance exploded as well and there was nothing to be found of any of them. The only physical thing we have left is Alberts blackened and dented cigarette case.
Prior to Albert joining up he had already displayed his courageous nature in 1908 by being awarded a Royal Humane Society Certificate for diving in and saving the life of a girl who had fallen into the River Severn near Tewkesbury. I have both the cigarette case and the framed RHS Certificate in my posession and would never part with either.
I thought I would share the exchange of letters. To me there is a marked decline in Alberts demeanour and there is a seeming lack of belief that he will return home alive referred to in one of his later letters.

William Hogan's story:

William Hogan was born on 26 July 1891 in Goresbridge, Co. Kilkenny. He joined the Metropolitan Police, London on 11 January 1915 and was stationed at Chelsea, B District.

He joined the army on 9 January, 1917 at the age of 25. He fought with the Household Battalion, a battaltion that was disbanded after two years and lasted from 1916 - 1918.
Some stories about him are noted in the book ""The Diary of a Forgotten Battalion"", by Gerard William Harvey (p. 36, 37, 39, 141). There is an eyewitness account of his death in the book noting that he received gun shot wounds to the thigh during a battle at Monchy-le-Preux. He was taken to No. 19 Casualty Clearing Station at Duisans. He died on 22 December, 1917 and is buried at Duisans British Cemetry, Pas de Calais, France.

His ""Widow's Penny"" is provided. This was given to his wife, Lilian Alice (née Griffin) in 1919. He had no children. I have also provided a photograph of William and his wife on their wedding day. I have been told that the insignia on his arm is for Corporal of the Ranks, and since he had only been in the army two months at this stage it seems likely that he borrowed this uniform for the occasion.

Patrick Hogan's story:

Patrick J. Hogan, was born c. 1896. He emigrated to the United States in 1905 and settled in Walpole, Massachusetts. He was conscripted, I think, into the army, about 1917 and was in the Machine Gun Regiment. I heard an account that he was carried a tripod and fed bullets, and that a shell exloded near him and killed him on the spot.
He was killed on 29 September 1918 in France, north of Verdun, and is buried at Meuse-Argonne American Cemetry. His name is on the war memorial in Walpole, Mass.

Their father wanted the bodies of both his sons repatriated to Ireland. The Americans were willing to do this, but the British were not. My grandfather decided that he wouldn't have one son without hte other, and so they both remain in France."

The second person from the right is Percival (Percy) Fillingham. Next to Percy, far right, sits the young Martha Asquith (nee Hogarth), to whom he would later propose.

Jim (James) Asquith is not in the picture but is also a very good friend of Percy Fillingham. Prior to leaving for the Great War, Jim and Percy were both engaged to be married and had agreed to look after the other's respective fiancé should something happen to them. JIM JAMES ASQUITH joined the third battalion (9th reinforcement) on the 30 June 1915, some 66 days after the same Battallion had landed in Gallipoli, Turkey on 25 April 1915. Jim was taken on strength. On the 30 September 1915, Jim departed Sydney on board HMAT8 Argyllshire bound for Egypt. Jim spent time in Cairo, Heliopolis and Alexandria. In Alexandria, the 3rd battalion was training and becoming fully manned again after Gallipoli. Jim was part of the 3rd Battalion's 9th reinforcement. On the 22 March 1916 Jim boarded the HMAS Grampian bound for the Western Front in France. On 28 March 1916 Jim arrived at Marseilles, France. The batallion would soon take part in operations against the German army, principally in the Somme Valley in France and around Ypres in Belgium. The battalion's first major action in France was at Pozières in the Somme valley in July 1916. Later the batallion fought at Ypres, in Flanders, before returning to the Somme for winter. Jim was wounded on the first occasion on 18 August 1916 on the left foot. It was not for another 2.5 months that he re-joined the unit only to be wounded on the 2nd occasion on 5 November 1916. His official war record observes wounds and states 'severe face and neck' whereas the notification sent to his father, Georges Asquith, on 6 December 1916 states 'gunshot wound, face and neck, mild'. Jim initially went to 18th General Hospital at Damme Camiers and was then sent back to England. In December 1916 Jim was sent back to a hospital in England. On 3 February 1917 Jim boarded S.S. Victoria from Folkenstone in England for France again and approximately a week later re-joined the unit in France. The battalion participated in a short period of mobile operations following the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in early 1917, but spent much of that year fighting in increasingly difficult conditions around Ieper. Jim was then wounded on a 3rd occasion on 6 May 1917 with a 'severe thigh wound'. Initially Jim was in Etaples Hospital, France and was then transferred to England, where he was operated on, before being discharged due to 'medical unfitness' from a severe wound on the left thigh and 'Necrosis of Fema' (premature or unnatural cell/tissue death likely from infection or trauma). Two pictures of Jim are shown (2, 3). THe third one shows Jim on return enjoying life at home in the backyard in Sydney. As you can see his left thigh was still injured and, indeed, his left thigh never really fully recovered as for the rest of his life it brought discomfort. PERCY (PERCIVAL) FILLINGHAM, first of left in the group picture of Australian soldiers (4), joined the 45th Battalion in March 1916 and was taken on strength. Parcy had two of his brothers in this war: Hubert Clement Fillingham, returned to Australia in March 1919 and Harold Walter Fillingham, returned to Australia in April 1919. Percy's war records show that he was wounded 3 times. It was upon being wounded the second time in September 1916 at the height of the Battle of the Somme that Percy suffered 'shell shock severe'. His war records note that he was 'buried' and being 'buried alive' in the trenches was commonly known to result in shell shock. Severe shell shock was noted through symptoms including combination of apparent neurological and psychological such as hysteria and anxiety; paralysis; limping; and muscle contractions; blindness and deafness; nightmares and insomnia; heart palpitations; depression; dizziness and disorientation; and loss of appetite. It is hypothesized that long-term bombardment with high explosive shells caused these symptoms. Percy also suffered Haemoptysis (coughing up of blood) in September 1916 and this is likely a result of the chlorine and phosgene gases used at the Somme. In May 1917 Percy re-joined his Battalion in the Northern Sector in Belgium in preparation for the Battle of Messines. It was in the opening hours of this battle that Percy was killed in action on 7 June 1917 at Messines, Belgium, at age 26, approximately. He has no known grave though his name is on the Roll of Honour at the Ypres Menin Gate Memorial, panel 27. Sadly for Jim James Asquith, not only his friend Percy died during the First World War. While he was in France, his fiancé contracted tuberculosis and died. In a strange, but wonderful twist of fate, a few years after Jim Asquith's return from war, he married Percy's fiancé, Martha Hogarth."

He was stationed in Beaune, France, and worked as a cook for Hospital Train #40. Soon after his return from the war in July 1919, he was asked by local newspaper -- the Moorefield WV Examiner -- to provide a short write-up of his military experience. Although he only saw combat from a distance, his brief ""memoir"" provides an interesting and sometimes amusing glimpse of France and the life of an American serviceman through the eyes of a small-town West Virginia farmboy -- one who likely had never traveled much beyond 100 miles of his home before he was drafted.

After the war, Luther lost his first wife, Ida Spain, to the Spanish Influenze epidemic sweeping the U.S., then married my grandmother, Ada Alice Bradfield, and he became a very successful teacher, cabinet-maker (working for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC), furniture-maker, and home-builder in Cumberland, Maryland. He also was a dedicated Bible scholar and Sunday School teacher. He died of a heart attack two months prior to my birth in 1995.

I remember, as a child, the stories he told about when he was in France. He was a driver but when the British Army was running out of canon fodder, he was sent to train for the front line in the &quot;Bull Ring&quot;. I have no idea where that was but he refers to it in his diary, which I have. On his way to the front line he was gassed and taken to hospital in Blighty. You can read the trauma he went through when he was told that he was being sent back to the front line and the sheer relief when he was subsequently told that he was being sent home after all. The diary was written in pencil and is very small so I have enlarged it when I scanned it in. I can also attach photos of my grandfather as well as letters to and from home.
During the war his brother, William, (born 12th November 1891) was killed. I understand that he was mounted on a front horse of a carriage team pulling a gun when he was struck by shrapnel, which killed him.

Jensen was born in Løgstør, Denmark, the third of four children. In 1908, he moved to England before he emigrated to Australia in March 1909 and worked in Australia for the next five years. A month after the war commenced, he was naturalised a British subject at Adelaide, South Australia, on 7 September 1914.[1]
Jensen served in the Australian Military Forces between March 1915 and December 1918.

When he was 26 years old and a Private in the 50th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.  Citation:
On 2 April 1917 at Noreuil, France, Private Jensen, with five comrades, attacked a barricade behind which were about 45 of the enemy and a machine-gun. One of the party shot the gunner and Private Jensen rushed the post and threw in a bomb. Then, with a bomb in each hand, he threatened the rest and made them surrender. He sent one of his prisoners to another group of the enemy, ordering them to surrender, which they did, but our troops began firing on them, where-upon Private Jensen, regardless of danger stood on the barricade waving his helmet, and the firing stopped. He then sent his prisoners back to our lines.

Formerly of the Bedfordshire Imperial Yeomanry with whom he served for eight years, he registered for National Reserve on the 29th January 1914 subsequently being sent to Remounts, France before allocation to the 5th Royal Irish Lancers.
On 28th / 29th November 1917 at Bourlon Wood, France, Private Clare, now a stretcher-bearer, dressed wounds and brought the wounded to the regiment's dressing station under most intense fire. At one period, when all the garrison of a detached post had become casualties he crossed to them through very heavy fire and, having dressed all the cases, manned the post single-handed until a relief could be sent. Then, after carrying a seriously wounded man through intense fire to the dressing station, he went, still under heavy fire, to every company post warning them that the enemy were using gas shells. Unfortunately this brave soldier was subsequently killed later during the day. He was aged 28.
His VC is publicly displayed at the The Queen's Royal Lancers Regimental Museum (Belvoir Castle, Lincolnshire, England). A stained glass window was placed in the south side of Chatteris parish church in his honour, depicting Christ rewarding a faithful soldier; it was dedicated in Sept 1918.

Cracker Jack is a popular caramel-coated popcorn snack, later to be associated with the sport of baseball in the minds of Americans. In 1918, Cracker Jack urged Americans to join the US Navy (their mascot was a boy in a sailor suit). Also, by eating the product, consumers could save valuable sugar and wheat for the war effort. The USA had just entered the war in 1917, so the patriotic fever was still strong with the American public.

120763,en,"Introduction: 

Milovan Milojević was born in 1889 in Azanja, a village in the Podunavlje district approximately 80 kilometres South-East of Serbia's capital Belgrade. 

He was the son of Stepan (1851-1927) and Ikonija Milojević. Milovan had three brothers, Čedomir (1883-1927), Milan (1893-?) and Stevan (1893-1987). Milovan was married to Stanica and they got two children: Svetomir (1909-died as a child) and Dragoslav (1912-1996). 

When he had to serve his country he was part of the 4th company, 1st battalion in the 8th regiment infantry, his rank has been unknown until so far. 

Azanja: 

The village where Milovan was born, Azanja, had 8803 inhabitants in 1910 (the Kingdom of Serbia had then 2.922.058 inhabitants). In 1921 the population of Azanja dropped to 8052 inhabitants.

The village of Azanja paid a huge price during the Balkan Wars and the First World War: it lost almost 800 soldiers during these wars, so far only around 400 were traced back. Azanja was back then, and still is, a rural village so it must have been a huge impact when such a high amount of men died because of the wars. 

Milovan was one of them, but also Djuro Stojadinović who died a day earlier in Nieuw-Milligen. Unfortunately we haven't been able to find his roots in Azanja yet.

Capture & Arrival in the Netherlands : 

According to the Prisoners of the First World War International Red Cross website we know that Milovan was captured 14/11/1915 in Kruševac (Central-Serbia). 

On 18/12/1915 he was reported in the Prisoners of War camp in Braunau (in Bohomia, nowadays the Czech Republic, back then part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire). The list was written 21/01/1916, see below. Jindřichovice and Braunau were used as transit camps in the beginning of the war and the Serbian Prisoners of War were mostly transported further into Germany.  

We know from earlier discoveries that they (Miloš Jeremić and Đorđe Vukosavljević) also spent time in camps in Soltau and Emden (in the province of Hannover or in German the  'Kriegsgefangenenlager des X. Armeekorps in Hannover'). Other soldiers who arrived in the Netherlands were held prisoners in the camps of the VII Korps Münster.

We do not know when Milovan arrived in the Netherlands, but at one point he was transported to the Prisoner of War camp in Nieuw-Milligen between Garderen and Apeldoorn. Also French soldiers were there waiting for transport to their home country, as the Serbian soldiers. We do not know when he was transported and from where (most possibly Enschede). According to the family we talked to he died on the train, but we cannot confirm this.

Burial and exhumation: 

Milovan died on the 21st January 1919 in Nieuw-Milligen (a village which is a part of the municipality of Apeldoorn) of Spanish flu.  A day later (22nd January 1919) autopsy was done by a doctor who concluded that Milovan died of Spanish flu. 

His death was registered by the municipality of Apeldoorn (act 71, date 23rd January 1919, which can be found here). This was reported by Jan David Mathias Schlaepfer, 49 years old Sergeant-Major in the Dutch army. Hendrik Muis, 45 years old civil servant, was the second person who registered his death. 

Milovan was buried on 24th January 1919 together with 11 of his comrades in Garderen (municipality of Barneveld). On the cemetery where he was buried a monument was erected in April 1919 by the legation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the Hague.

The text was in French and it was written ""les soldats serbes décédés au camp de Millingen 1919"" with 29 names in French transcription, and on the back in Serbian and Dutch the text ""Deceased for Serbia / the grateful Serbian fatherland"" (""Умрли за Србију"" / ""Gestorven voor Serbie"", ""Благодарна Отаџбина Србија"" / ""Het Dankbaar Serbische Vaderland"").

In May 1938, he was exhumed (together with the other Serbian WWI graves) and transported to Jindřichovice. The exhumation report can be found below. Even though the newspaper articles in 1938 mentioned that the remains of '89 Serbian soldiers' were repatriated to 'Yugoslavia', the official documents of the time mention 'Czechoslovakia' as the destination.

The remains of Milovan and 87 others were transferred to Jindřichovice in Czechoslovakia (nowadays Czech Republic) via the Dutch/German border at Beek-Wyler. It is not known in which box his remains were collected as on his Serbian exhumation report (no K. Br. 84024/XII) it is not mentioned. It must be one of the lead boxes numbered 45, 61-65, or 67-89 as for the other numbers the names were mentioned.

Milovan found his last resting place in Jindřichovice, together with 7658 other Serbian soldiers and 189 Russian soldiers (calculated as on 1940). 


Discovery: 

After contacts with officials of the municipality of Smederevska Palanka (Azanja is part of that municipality nowadays) we got the contact information of Žarko Talijan which we contacted afterwards. He wrote a book about Azanja and the victims of the Balkan Wars and the First World War and wanted to meet us. When we met 19/03/2016 in Azanja he showed us, together with a relative of Milovan, the monument on the graveyard of Azanja.

This was actually the first monument we have seen so far where it was written where the soldier died.

On the monument is written: 'Milovan sin Stepana Milojevića vojnik žive 30 g. umre 6-1.1919 g. u Milingenu u Holandiji. Spomen dižu ožalošćeni otac mati braća sin i supruga. 

Translation: Milovan, a son of Stepan Milojević, a soldier, lived for 30 years, died 6.1.1919. in Miligen in the Netherlands. The monument erected by his bereaved father, brothers, son and wife.

Conclusion: 

With the help of the civil servants of Smederevska Palanka we contacted Žarko Talijan and together with Damir Živković they gave us the information we needed.

We met a family member and gave copies of the official Dutch & Serbian acts and pictures of the monument in Garderen and the mausoleum in Jindřichovice to him. At least now they know that he has not been forgotten and that his name is written on the monument in Garderen, that there is a cross for him as well there and that his remains are in the mausoleum in Jindřichovice.

We are very grateful for the picture of Milovan, as he is now not just a name any more, but a person with a face and a history. He died in the Netherlands with his comrades far from Serbia, but 100 years later both countries did not forget him and his comrades.

120087,en,"‘“ FORGET-ME-NOT ”’ is printed in the top left-hand corner of this pale-lilac-coloured postcard, which bears a pencilled scribble in the centre, while ‘“ LONGING FOR YOU. ”’ appears in the bottom right-hand corner. A line of music, at the centre of which has been depicted a cherub and lyre, is the only decorative element. Five verses below, headed ‘To my Dear Little “ Chicks. ” / A Soldier’s Verse Letter to his children.’, read as follows. ‘My dear little Chicks I’m thinking of YOU, / And dear Mother throughout the long day ; / And wonder at times how you’re getting on, / While your Daddy’s so far away. // Now, be good children, and don’t worry Mummy, / Then when I come home again on “ leave; ” / My “ Kit Bag ” I’ll fill with Toys and Good Things, / Like Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. // Now, tell dear Mummy, I’d like to have, / A photo of you all––as you are ; / Just to cheer me up while “ doing my bit.” / Though the distance between us is far. // I dreamt last night I was home again, / With you and Mother so dear ; / But at early dawn the Buglers blew / “ Reveille ” in tones loud and clear. // FORGET-ME-NOT, my thoughts are of YOU, / While marching or from drill set free ; / My loving thoughts for ever turn, / To Home––and Dear Ones––far from me.’. ‘From ………….’ has been printed in the bottom left-hand corner, but the sender has not filled in his name.

The postmark on the reverse tells us that it was posted in Bulford [Wiltshire] on 26 April 1915. The recipient’s name and address has been pencilled below that: “Mrs C Duke / Stone Cottage / Ashurst Wood / East Grinstead / Sussex’. The message reads, ‘Dear May / Just a line in hope it will find you all quite well as it leaves me to [sic] at present. What lovely weather we are having. Hope everything is going on all right at home do not be surprised [?] me come in at any time, I am still working in the cookhouse don’t seem to have any more news so will close with love from Charles’.

A search of FreeBMD reveals that Charles Duke married May I Drew in the June quarter of 1913 (Cuckfield 2b 329) – Cuckfield then being in Sussex, and now in West Sussex. Ancestry.co.uk indicates that they had two children: Eric C Duke, whose birth was registered in the July quarter of 1913 at East Grinstead (2b 239); and Winifred M Duke, whose birth was registered in the April quarter of 1915, again in East Grinstead (2b 209). These must have been the ‘Chicks’ whom he had in mind when sending this postcard, assuming that Winifred had been born before 26 April 1915."

119508,en,"Document 2 titled 'Universal Peace and the Teaching of History', contains notes for a speech that was delivered by E.C. Warriner at the University of Michigan Summer School on August 7, 1914.
One of the reasons that these notes are of interest concerns the fact that they were composed at the very beginning of the World War I. Even at the early date, Warriner notes the role of racism in the war: “Cause - Archduke Ferdinand” - this is a pretext - Real Cause Race Hatred.” Another reason why this document is of interest is because it illustrates the widespread concern amongst peace activists that education - specifically the teaching of history - emphasizes the stories of battles and military conquests at the expense of more positive stories involving “peace history”. In these notes, Warriner lists a number of positive stories of peace history that should be included in history courses. Among the stories listed are those concerning The Hague Peace Conferences, the peace philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie, and the establishment of the American School Peace League."

It contains words and phrases relating to geographic terms, general phrases, numbers, nationalities, orientation, weather, transport, and so on,  as well as military ones relating to troops and arms, combat, fortifications, and so on, including for interrogating suspects. 

The 1915 date is of significance because that is when, in October of that year, the Germans, Austro-Hungarians, and Bulgarians attacked Serbia from all sides and forced, ultimately, the winter retreat of the Serbian Army through the mountains of Albania. France and Britain sent a two-division expeditionary force to Salonika which, as it tuned out, unfortunately, was too little too late. 

So, having a Franco-Serb/Franco-Greek Vocabulary would have helped the regular French soldier to hopefully be able to get on and communicate with their Greek and Serbian allies.

I have three (family) photographs of the staff and patients of this hospital. I do not have the dates when these images were taken.

Dr. Lernau lived in Glogau from 1899 till his death in 1932. His wife, Gertrud Lernau, moved to Berlin and was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942. She survived the camp, and later emigrated to Israel. Their daughter Charlotte (later Sonia Preux) emigrated during WW2 to Mexico, and their son (my father) Hans Ludwig (later Hanan) Lernau emigrated in 1923 to Palestine.

Photo Hospital 1: Shows a group of patients standing on a flight of steps, probably outside the hospital. Every face is very clear and identifiable. Paul is standing in front with three nurses on each side. Two orderlies stand in the rear. Some patients have bandaged ears or throats.

Photo Hospital 2: Shows doctors and staff in a patients&#039; room. Paul stands in the middle with the same 6 nurses around him. Two additional officers (?) stand on both sides. They might be physicians but they do not carry a red cross on their sleeve like Paul and the nurses. So they might have been administrators. There are patient beds behind the group, with patients&#039; names inscribed. On the left there is one half-hidden patient in bed, looking into the camera as well. He is holding to his nose some instrument, probably a nebulizer (?).  Paul and the officers are in uniforms which might give a clue to their army units. The officer on the right and Paul have their swords.  The nurses were probably also residents of Glogau.

Photo Hospital 3: This photo is the most interesting one. It shows a Christmas celebration for staff and patients. It takes place inside a synagogue as can be recognized by the stars of David along the upper walls. There is an inscription &quot;Froehliche Weihnacht.&quot; (Happy Christmas) attached to the curtain which covers the ark of the synagogue, and a Christmas tree stands to the left. There is not enough room along the long table in the middle, and some patients and staff and guests stand in the rear. There is not much food on the table other then apples (or potatoes?). Several patients are bandaged. Each of the seated patients has some kind of a roll in front of him, the purpose of which is not clear to me. It might contain a slip of paper which some of the patients hold in their hands. One can imagine that these papers contained songs or prayers for the celebration(?). At the end of the table stands a priest. Paul stands to his left. Gertrud Lernau, Paul&#039;s wife, in a black dress and a black hat, stands in the right rear with Charlotte her daughter in front of her. Hans Ludwig my father (born in 1902) sits on the fourth chair on the right side. Patients were hospitalized in this hall as can be recognized by the patients&#039; beds on the rear on both sides. 
There was a large imposing synagogue in Glogau (burned down in 1938). Photographs of its interior do not fit the hall in this photo, which means that the celebration took place either in a secondary hall of the same synagogue, or in another one, about which I have no information. The combination of a patient ward inside a synagogue, with Christmas celebration, with priest and a Christmas tree - all this makes this image so special.

I am interested to get any information about the hospital, the staff members or the patients.

Contents  [hide] 


At the outbreak of war, the 1st Battalion East Surreys were deployed as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into northern Belgium. Roupell commanded a platoon in the BEF's first major action; the Battle of Mons in August 1914. Roupell kept a diary throughout the war which has since been a useful, and sometimes humorous, source of insight and observation on the events that he witnessed and participated in. In the trenches at Mons he recounted how he had to hit his men on the backside with his sword in order to gain their attention and remind them to fire low as they had been taught!
Soon after, following the retreat from Mons in September, he led his platoon in the first Battle of the Aisne. Once again, Roupell came under heavy fire, this time whilst crossing the Aisne on a raft. The Surrey's advance was pushed back with heavy casualties.
Early the following year, during the continued fighting around Ypres, Roupell was 23 years old, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. His citation reads:
For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on 20 April 1915, when he was commanding a company of his battalion in a front trench on ""Hill 60,"" which was subjected to a most severe bombardment throughout the day. Though wounded in several places, he remained at his post and led his company in repelling a strong German assault. During a lull in the bombardment he had his wounds hurriedly dressed, and then insisted in returning to his trench, which was again being subjected to severe bombardment. Towards evening, his company being dangerously weakened, he went back to his battalion headquarters, represented the situation to his Commanding Officer, and brought up reinforcements, passing backwards and forwards over ground swept by heavy fire. With these reinforcements he held his position throughout the night, and until his battalion was relieved next morning.
This young Officer was one of the few survivors of his company, and showed a magnificent example of courage, devotion and tenacity, which undoubtedly inspired his men to hold out till the end  Corporal Edward Dwyer VC (25 November 1895 – 3 September 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross born in Fulham, London, on 25 November 1895.
He was 19 years old, and a Private in the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment, British Army during World War I, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 20 April 1915 at Hill 60, Belgium.  Citation:
For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty at ""Hill 60"" on the 20th April, 1915. When his trench was heavily attacked by German grenade throwers he climbed on to the parapet, and, although subjected to a hail of bombs at close quarters, succeeded in dispersing the enemy by the effective use of his hand grenades. Private Dwyer displayed great gallantry earlier on this day in leaving his trench, under heavy shell fire, to bandage his wounded comrades.

105454,en,"On 25 January 1915 the 29 year old Thomas Whitham enlisted at Burnley, Lancashire into the British Army becoming a Private in the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards.
He embarked for France on the 26 October 1915 and joined the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards who had been serving in France and Flanders since their arrival on the 13 August 1914. The battalion that Private Whittam joined would have borne no resemblance to the original unit which had by now, suffered unimaginable casualties. Two years later, on the 31 July 1917 at Pilckem near Passchendaele, the opening day of the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31st July - 2nd August 1917) the 1st Coldsteam Guards formed part of the 2nd Brigade of the Guards Division. At 3.50 a.m. - zero hour, the brigade attacked the German forces at the so called 'Blue Line'.  Initially the advance met little resistance,arriving at this position after only 15 minutes of fighting. At 5 a.m. the Brigade continued its advance to its second objective, the 'Black Line', which it captured by 6 a.m. The third objective, the 'Green Line', was attacked at 7.15 a.m.; but now came under heavy machine gun fire from the blockhouses/positions on the old Ypres - Staden railway line, which also began to affect the advance of the 38th Division on their right flank. A particular enemy machine gun was seen to be, by enfilade, holding up a considerable part of the attack and causing many casualties. Private Whitham, on his own initiative, immediately worked his way towards this position, from shell-hole to shell-hole, and through a British artillery barrage, until he reached the machine gun and although under very heavy fire captured it together with an officer and two other ranks. This very brave action was of great assistance to the battalion and undoubtedly saved many lives.

After the war he became a bricklayer, but times were hard, and he was rejected for other jobs by the Burnley Council even though he had served his King and Country and had won the VC. Consequently Thomas was forced to sell not only the medal but also a gold watch that had been presented by the same council (that now refused to employ him)in recognition of his bravery. Subsequently, both ended up in a pawn shop, but were retrieved by the same Authority. They now remain on display in the Towneley Hall Art Gallery & Museums in Burnley. Shamefully, Thomas died in poverty aged only 36

The story starts as he is aiming his rifle at one of his own men who is attempting to surrender because their trench is being overrun, and their position no longer tenable. My great-grandfather is knocked unconscious by schrapnel at the moment he intends to shoot his own man, and spends the next four years in various German POW camps.

This diary, which is one in a series documenting his years serving the King in the British Army, documents in fine detail his attitude to his captors, and fellow inmates. The language and attitudes are often shocking to our over-sensitive politically correct ears, but tell an engaging story of one soldier trying to make sense of his captivity.

He returned home in 1917 during a prisoner exchange in Switzerland. Confronted with ambivalent attitudes to his service and capture by his compatriots, and not being able to empathise with the horrors of the western front, he becomes disillusioned.

A great cartoonist and draughtsman, one of the delights of these diaries are the constant drawings and sketches that elaborate the daily entries. The tone of the diaries is often mired in minutiae, which reflects the desolation of spirit a captured soldier must feel."

105453,en,"Wilfred Edwards enlisted as Private in the 7th Battalion, The King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI)during the First World War and was awarded the VC for his actions on 16 August 1917 at Langemarck, Belgium, during the Battle of 3rd Ypres.  On that day the 7th KOYLI were tasked to advance and capture enemy positions to their front, unfortunately for them, besides trenches, they also contained concrete blockhouses from which the battalion was lashed by machine gun fire.  This caused the death or injury of all his company's officers, thereby creating confusion and halting the advance.  At this time Private Edwards, without hesitation and under heavy machine gun and rifle fire, ran forward and threw grenades ('bombed') through the loopholes; he then, with enormous risk to himself, actually climbed on top of the construction and waved to his company to advance. Continuing aggression on his part was rewarded by the three German officers and 30 other ranks who occupied the blockhouse surrendering to him. Later during the advance he did most valuable work as a messenger('runner') and eventually guided most of the battalion out through very difficult ground, again a most dangerous task.

Edwards was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in December 1917 and was demobilised in June 1919. He re-enlisted in the army when World War II broke out and rose to the rank of Major.

He died in January 1972 and his medals are currently displayed in the Kings Own Yorkshire Light Infantry Museum, Doncaster, England. The attached account of his actions was written by James Price Lloyd of the Welsh Regiment, who served with Military Intelligence. After the war, the government to destroyed all the archives relating to this propaganda (section MI 7b (1)). They were regarded as being too sensitive to risk being made public. Remarkably these documents have survived in the personal records of Captain Lloyd. Many of these papers are officially stamped, and one can trace the development of many individual articles from the notes based on an idea, to the pencil draft which is then followed by the hand-written submission and the typescript. The archive ""Tales of the VC"" comprises 94 individual accounts of the heroism that earned the highest award for valour, the Victoria Cross. These are recounted deferentially and economically, yet they still manage to move the reader.

117064,en,"This story relates to the contributor&#039;s father, Thomas William Arthur Smart, always known as William or Will. He was born on October 11th, 1891 in Wigston near Leicester. It is not known exactly when he joined up, but he was certainly in the Army in 1916, as the contributor has a postcard with this date on it. It is known from the contributor&#039;s mother that William was vaccinated against small pox and had a bad reaction to it.  He contracted peritonitis and was seriously ill, which delayed him going to the Front. In 1917 he had double pneumonia, sent to Rugeley Camp Military Hospital, and he was so ill that they sent for his sister, as they did not think that he would live. The contributor&#039;s mother said the fact that he was in a military hospital saved him, because he had 24 hour care. He was told that he didn&#039;t have to go to the Front and could have an office job instead, but he insisted that he wanted to go.

He went to the Front in 1918, reaching Boulogne on March 7th, 1918. He was in the Lincoln Regiment, Private W Smart, service number 43446. He had previously been in the South Staffordshire Regiment, but the contributor has a diary, in which he recorded his daily experiences, and on 7th March he records that he was drafted to the Lincolns. He then moved to the Front, and records his journey and subsequent experiences. 

On the 14th April he moved up to the line and took over some hastily dug trenches from another company. They were told that &quot;Jerry&quot; was a mile away. He wrote and later talked about being surrounded under fire. They were captured on the 15th or 16th and then marched to Armentières. Their eventual destination was a French barracks in Lille.  They were hungry and thirsty and had their pocket knives taken away. He records, sending a POW card to Lily, his sister, on 17th April, that there were 353 men all crowded into a small room, 20&#039; x 50&#039;, with awful sanitary arrangements and alive with lice. His diary also records all kinds of details of what they had to eat, where they were moved to, the work they had to do, medical treatments, such as inoculations that he was given, female civilians being forced to work and so on. He also talks about stealing food when they were sent to work at a ration dump at the station. He was a prisoner for the rest of the war, in a variety of places in Belgium, and in October left for Bavaria. When the war finally ended he was in a camp at Hammelburg. On November 10th 1918 he notes that the &quot;Jerries&quot; were leaving the camp and heard about the general Armistice on the 12th. They remained at the camp and had a photograph taken in the village on 16th December. He travelled back to Switzerland, travelling through Germany on the 22nd December. He finally arrived home in England on 30th December on the &quot;Caledonian&quot; and back to his home near Leicester on 2nd January.

After the war he went back to his job in the Co-Operative offices in Wigston, Leicester. He married a Belgian girl, Helene Geens, in 1928, whom he had met on holiday. She had been a refugee in Prestatyn during the war; see story entitled: Belgian Refugees in North Wales."

Sam and Ernie had diabetes and didn't go to the war, and my father, born in 1904, was too young to serve. Bill joined a horse regiment during the war. He was gassed but survived and he survived the war, too. Joe was born on 7 July 1893. During the war he served in the Army Corps of Cyclists, 36th Division attached to the 10th Corps Cyclist Battalion. Joe was at the Somme, Ypres and we think in Flanders, too. He used to visit my family every Christmas but although I was interested in the war, Joe would never talk about it. However, Joe did an interview for the Irish Times newspaper in July 1976 for the 60th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme and shared his memories: ""I don't know whether I was afraid. You couldn't have time then to think or to have nerves. Our nerves was gone, sure, by that time. We were on ordinary push bikes, bikes you'd see in the street, you know. Our jobs were different: sometimes to go ahead and report on the German's movements and sometimes going behind the lines or then maybe carrying ammunition. We were meant to work together with the cavalry, them in the fields and us on the road. But there wasn't much cavalry at the Somme, I think, I can't remember all that much, I was only in my 20s…But I do remember that when the fighting started you couldn't be worried about fear or anything. The place was full of machine guns, rockets, hand bombs and terrible noise. Explosions going off all the time. I know we went over the top in a three-way move, one on the right, the 36th in the middle, and one on the left. How did I survive? I was one of the lucky ones that got through, that's all. My number mustn't have been up…The weather was melting, like now it was. And they couldn't get food to us, only our emergency rations. Terrible stuff: a tin of bully beef and a few hard biscuits."" Joe was severely gassed in 1917 but he survived and was in France the day the war ended. ""All I remember is hearing the command to cease fire…and then the cafes and the pubs opened and we got some free beer."" Joe worked in Clery's in Dublin once he had recovered from the war and spent over forty years as an employee there. He died in 1978 and is buried in St Munn's graveyard, Taghmon."

On one particular day I was asked to go to a house in Marston St Lawrence, between Banbury and Brackley to catalogue items from a recently deceased estate for a forthcoming sale. I was to meet a Mr Blencowe who would instruct me further.

On arrival at the very attractive cottage, I was greeted by Mr Blencowe, then in his 90s and was told that the family had originally lived in The Vicarage in Marston St Lawrence. The cottage being bought by the parents on their retirement. Mr Blencowe had had one brother Oswald but he had been killed in the Great War and, I think a sister and it was this sister who had recently died. Mr Blencowe was moving into sheltered housing and couldn't keep much in the way of possessions.

The house was a veritable treasure trove of late 19th and early 20th century artifacts as well as some older antiques. Much of it sentimental family items alluding to a busy, happy and tragic past. Among these items were three letters in a very battered and broken leather case. Dated 1916 and ""On Active Service"" boldly printed on the enveloped I couldn't help but have a closer look at them. They were all from Mr Blencowe's brother Oswald to his mother and were extraordinarily moving. I read and reread them before mentioning that I had found them and how moving they were. With a weak smile Mr Blencowe explained that they were from his brother who had been killed shortly after the last one was sent. He said he wanted to take two of them with him but that he would very much like me to have the other. I have treasured it ever since."

At a rally in Swan View, Wexford, Connolly's platform was surrounded by a bodyguard of local men for fear of attack by the police. John Clowry was part of that bodyguard. At the outbreak of the war he joined the British Army as a member of the Royal Irish Regiment. He saw action on many fronts and was taken prisoner.

117098,en,"John Henry Fisher was conscripted at the age of 37 to the 13th Infantry Labour Corps of the Lincolnshire Regiment. He was married with two children, Jack and Gladys and was employed as a clerk at Tetley's Brewery in Leeds.

Within two weeks of being called up in March 1917 he was in France working behind the Front Line in the Arras area. His job was to ensure equipment and resources got to the soldiers who were fighting on the Front Line. This included loading shells in to cases which were then loaded on to wagons to be taken to the Front Line, and then unloading the wagons on their return. He was engaged in much dangerous work including the testing of gas masks. Whilst working here he witnessed the Canadians taking Vimy Ridge and saw German prisoners being marched back through his village. 

In September 1917 he was moved to the Ypres area of Flanders and was now attached to the Royal Artillery Garrison. Work continued to supply the Front Line with equipment under the constant shelling from ""Fritz"". He also worked on digging trenches, laying barbed wire, concreting dug outs, clearing the Menin Road and working on the light railway at Sanctuary Wood. He had some narrow escapes and was invalided twice to hospital: once with dysentery and secondly with an injured hand which resulted in him being sent back home on sick leave. 

Even on Armistice Day he was out working building a railway bridge and dangerous work continued digging up mines the Germans had laid under the railway lines during their retreat.

The men who served in the Labour Corps did essential logistic work during the war and yet are very much overlooked and forgotten. They served unarmed and frequently within the range of the German guns undertaking a wide range of menial, hard and dangerous tasks. They experienced the same sights and sounds of the fighting soldiers and I believe it is important to tell the stories of their experiences so we may appreciate the ""behind the scenes"" activities during the Great War and give these men the recognition and thanks they so rightly deserve.

Wikipedia description of history of the Selective Service Act 1917:
By the guidelines set down by the Selective Service Act, all males aged 21 to 30 were required to register for military service. At the request of the War Department, Congress amended the law in August 1918 to expand the age range to include all men 18 to 45, and to bar further volunteering. By the end of World War I, some 2 million men volunteered for various branches of the armed services, and some 2.8 million had been drafted. This meant that more than half of the almost 4.8 million Americans who served in the armed forces were drafted."

Contents  [hide] 


At the outbreak of war, the 1st Battalion East Surreys were deployed as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into northern Belgium. Roupell commanded a platoon in the BEF&#039;s first major action; the Battle of Mons in August 1914. Roupell kept a diary throughout the war which has since been a useful, and sometimes humorous, source of insight and observation on the events that he witnessed and participated in. In the trenches at Mons he recounted how he had to hit his men on the backside with his sword in order to gain their attention and remind them to fire low as they had been taught!
Soon after, following the retreat from Mons in September, he led his platoon in the first Battle of the Aisne. Once again, Roupell came under heavy fire, this time whilst crossing the Aisne on a raft. The Surrey&#039;s advance was pushed back with heavy casualties.
Early the following year, during the continued fighting around Ypres, Roupell was 23 years old, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. His citation reads:
For most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on 20 April 1915, when he was commanding a company of his battalion in a front trench on &quot;Hill 60,&quot; which was subjected to a most severe bombardment throughout the day. Though wounded in several places, he remained at his post and led his company in repelling a strong German assault. During a lull in the bombardment he had his wounds hurriedly dressed, and then insisted in returning to his trench, which was again being subjected to severe bombardment. Towards evening, his company being dangerously weakened, he went back to his battalion headquarters, represented the situation to his Commanding Officer, and brought up reinforcements, passing backwards and forwards over ground swept by heavy fire. With these reinforcements he held his position throughout the night, and until his battalion was relieved next morning.
This young Officer was one of the few survivors of his company, and showed a magnificent example of courage, devotion and tenacity, which undoubtedly inspired his men to hold out till the end  Corporal Edward Dwyer VC (25 November 1895 – 3 September 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross born in Fulham, London, on 25 November 1895.
He was 19 years old, and a Private in the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment, British Army during World War I, and was awarded the VC for his actions on 20 April 1915 at Hill 60, Belgium.  Citation:
For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty at &quot;Hill 60&quot; on the 20th April, 1915. When his trench was heavily attacked by German grenade throwers he climbed on to the parapet, and, although subjected to a hail of bombs at close quarters, succeeded in dispersing the enemy by the effective use of his hand grenades. Private Dwyer displayed great gallantry earlier on this day in leaving his trench, under heavy shell fire, to bandage his wounded comrades.

One particular instance is his diary entry for the 10th of August 1915 describing a march he would never forget, 3.5 miles in dreadful conditions.  Through ""thick shiny mud"" sinking up to their knees, having to rest every 120 yards he wrote that he ""nearly cried"" at the end of that day, which highlights the severity of the conditions given that George was a professional soldier with considerable service.

105457,en,"Private John Robertson, Canadian Infantry, was awarded the V.C. for bravery near Passchendaele on 6th November 1917. He was killed during this action. Private Robinson was a soldier serving in the 27th Canadian Infantry (Manitoba Regiment) during the infamous Battle of Passchendaele. During an advance towards the German positions his platoon was held up by uncut wire and a machine gun causing many casualties. Robertson moved quickly to an opening on the flank, rushed the machine gun and, after a desperate struggle with the crew, killed four and then turned the gun on the remainder, who, overcome by the fierceness of his attack retreated by running towards their own lines. This brave action enabled the platoon to advance. He inflicted many more casualties among the enemy and then, carrying the captured machine gun, he led his platoon to the final objective where he selected an excellent position and got the gun again into action targeting the retreating enemy who by this time were quite demoralised by the fire brought to bear on them. During the consolidation of the new position Pte. Robertson continued to use the machine gun to bring down fire on enemy snipers; it is considered that this example of courage and coolness seemingly encouraged his comrades and inspired them to even greater efforts. Later, when two Canadian snipers were badly wounded in front of the trench he went out and carried one of them in under very heavy fire. Robertson was killed just as he returned with the second man.

This account of his actions was written by James Price Lloyd of the Welsh Regiment, who served with Military Intelligence. After the war, the government to destroyed all the archives relating to this propaganda (section MI 7b (1)). They were regarded as being too sensitive to risk being made public. Remarkably these documents have survived in the personal records of Captain Lloyd. Many of these papers are officially stamped, and one can trace the development of many individual articles from the notes based on an idea, to the pencil draft which is then followed by the hand-written submission and the typescript. The archive &quot;Tales of the VC&quot; comprises 94 individual accounts of the heroism that earned the highest award for valour, the Victoria Cross. These are recounted deferentially and economically, yet they still manage to move the reader."

He was aged 37, married with 2 children when he signed up to serve King and Countery on 22nd December 1914, an act of great patriotism as there were many men much younger and without dependant families who might have served in his place. Walter was employed in civilian life as a chauffeur and so was allocated to the Army Service Corps Mechanical Transport Section (Army number 031643) as a Motor Lorry Driver. The Army Service Corps managed the vast supply needs of the army on many fronts and were a stragically important factor in maintaining supplies for the army as it made considerable advances over difficult ground. They operated in a variety of roles, providing food, equipment and amunition as well as transporting casualties to clearing stations and hospitals. In 1916 Walter was admitted to hospital in Brighton due to spinal injuries sustained whilst on active service. In hospital he wrote poetry reflecting his and his comrades war experience and expressing his patriotism and love of his country. This poems is attached to this story.
Walter Nicholson was invalided out of the war in 1916 and spent the remaining years of the conflict making munitions. After the war he developed an interest in fossils and created a wayside museum exhibiting the fossils he collected in his work quarrying. He was also an amateur opera singer.

I also have a picture of some Royal Marine Artillery, taken at Becourt, on the Somme, 3rd.August 1916, the man on the extreme right of the picture , is the DOUBLE of ME, who is he?

Editor&#039;s comment:
SHELL: In 1915 Britain acquired a number of &quot;autocanon de 75 mm mle 1913&quot; anti-aircraft guns, as a stopgap measure while it developed its own anti-aircraft alternatives. They were used in the defence of Britain, usually mounted on de Dion motor lorries using the French mounting which the British referred to as the &quot;Breech Trunnion&quot;. Britain also purchased a number of the standard 75 mm guns and adapted them for AA use using a Coventry Ordnance Works mounting, the &quot;Centre Trunnion&quot;. At the Armistice there were 29 guns in service in Britain.
The head stamps on the case should confirm which factory. &quot;FN&quot; on a French 75mm indicates that the case was made by the Fonderie Nationale de Nanterre. So the shell was (likely) made in Nantere and was probably fired from a British adapted mount in the AA role.
PHOTO: There is no obvious way to identify a random WW1 British serviceman from a photo unless there are other clues from uniform, badges and captions. In this instance all that helps is the Royal Marine Artillery connection (His hat badge is that of the RMA). Worth trying RM museum at Portsmouth maybe - but an extremely long shot unless they happen to have another photo of the same man, or a captioned version of this one."

He was a driver but when the British Army was running out of canon fodder, he was sent to train for the front line in the ""Bull Ring"". I have no idea where that was but he refers to it in his diary, which I have. On his way to the front line he was gassed and taken to hospital in Blighty. You can read the trauma he went through when he was told that he was being sent back to the front line and the sheer relief when he was subsequently told that he was being sent home after all.

My grandmother, Ada Marie Flynn (1893-1981), of Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland and Greenore, Co Louth, served as a munitions worker during the war, as attested to by her “On War Service” triangular badge. Her brother,  Oweson Flynn (born 1896), served as an officer in the 5th Bn., The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment. Ada’s sister, Vi (born 1897), married Charles Joseph Mackay, an officer in the 5th Bn., The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment. During the war he transferred to the RFC (Royal Flying Corps). He was awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and Croix de Guerre. In addition to her own munitions work, Ada corresponded with an Irishman she barely knew, a prisoner of war in Germany. Ada&#039;s sister Sheila married John Donal Carroll, MC (1917) Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and later Colonel in the Irish Free State Army Medical Service (1921-1925). He died in 1928 aged 38.


My grandfather, Captain James Cecil Joseph Corballis (1891-1947), came from the Corballis family of Co Meath. He was the eldest son of Captain James Frederick Joseph Corballis of Ratoath Manor, Ratoath, Co Meath, himself a veteran of the Boer War who became a recruiting officer for the British Army during the War. James was affectionately known as ‘Tommy’, and became an officer in the 5th Bn., The Prince of Wales’s Leinster Regiment. He served in France. ‘Tommy’ and Ada married in  January 1918.

Tommy’s brother, Richard Arthur (1893-1921) became an officer in the 3rd Bn. The Dorsetshire Regiment. He was severely wounded on 25th April 1915 at Hill 60. He died of his wounds in Penzance in March 1921.

Another of Tommy&#039;s brothers, Basil Joseph (1896-1966), became an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry. While seconded to the MGC (Machine Gun Corps) he was awarded the Military Cross on the first day of the battle of the Somme, 1st July 1916. Tommy’s sister, Barbara Marie (1892-1967) served with the VAD (Voluntary Aid Detachment) in England. She married Brigadier William Moxhay Sutton, DSO MC.

Tommy’s aunt (sister of the afore-mentioned Captain James Frederick Joseph Corballis),  May (Emily Mary) (1873-1940), joined the nursing Order of Saint Vincent de Paul as a Sister of Charity. The name she took was Soeur Marguerite. At the outbreak of the Great War she was attached to a hospital in Monaco. She was sent to run the frontline Hospital of Saint Louis in Roubaix, occupied France, to nurse wounded French, English and German soldiers. Having been arrested by the Germans allegedly for spying, she was imprisoned in Rastatt, Germany. She wrote to the Kaiser to demand her release. Her plea was successful and she returned to nursing for the remainder of the War, mainly at Souilly. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the SBM Red Cross medal and finally, in 1927, the Legion d’Honneur in Strasbourg in which City a street was named in her honour.

Their names were Ernest Samuel Meyer, born on 24th April 1886, Frank Spencer Meyer, born on 5th July 1887, and Arthur William Meyer, born on 11th August 1892. They were all born in Bray, Co. Wicklow and are listed on the 1901 Bray Census, but the family emmigrated to Winnipeg, Canada in 1909 seeking a better life, working in the grain industry. 

At the outbreak of war, both Arthur and Frank enlisted in the Winnipeg Rifles (Little Black Devils) and took the Oath of allegiance on 23rd September 1914. Their letters, date sequenced, came first from Canada then England (Salisbury Plain) then from France as they were crossing to the front, writing about meeting the locals. 

Arthur was reported missing in action on the 15th April and presumed dead on 25th April 1915 at the 2nd Battle of Ypres. He is listed on the memorial Menin Gate at Ypres, Belgium, and died a Corporal at just 22 years of age.  

Frank was captured (also at the 2nd Battle of Ypres) and taken a Prisoner of War (POW) on 23rd April 1915. From the family archives and from transcripts of his diary (transcribed by his daughter) we learned that Frank was moved around while a POW and ended up in a German work camp. Also, from the university archives in Winnipeg, we have photographs of Frank at the prison camp. He survived the war, married in September 1924 and died on 16th July, 1951.

Ernest, who was married and had two sons, Alan and Gerhard (Gerry) born 1913 and 1914 respectively, enlisted and took the Oath of Allegiance on 23rd December 1915 (after Arthur’s death). He was also in the Winnipeg Rifles. He was involved in the Battle of Amiens, the last 100 days, and was killed instantly on 9th August 1918 during an advance where he faced intense enemy machine gun fire. He died in the village of Caix and is buried there in the Manitoba Cemetery. Private Ernest Meyer was 33 years old."

Harold was in the Royal Garrison Artillery, and because of this, spent his war firing heavy artillery rather than in the trenches. Although Rosemary feels like her dad had a relatively safe war, he suffered from hearing and balance problems all his life that were probably related to his service. Harold’s experience reminds us that men were not able to go home straight after the armistice was signed, many had to stay in the army to deal with the aftermath of the war. In 1919 he was sent to Germany where he served, with great success, as a clerk at Army Head Quarters within the Rhine Army.

104115,en,"After the family moved to Gellydywyll, Llandinam in 1915 John Jones continued to work at Plas Dinam for another year; but in Nov 1916, as more and more young men from the village were enlisting in the army, John decided that he too would join up. He was 18 years old when he left home to join the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in Welshpool.  He was sent home for Christmas and told to report to Wrexham at the end of the year.  On arrival in Wrexham he failed to get accommodation at the Barracks and was put up in Abbot St. - B &amp; B 1/-.   The following day he reported to the Barracks, joined up on 9th Jan 1917 and was sent on to Oswestry for training at Park Hall Camp with the 4th Res. R.W.F...  He remained there until April when there was a call for farm workers. He volunteered and was told to report to Mr Jones, Pertheiryn, Pontdolgoch, Caersws.  He worked there for seven weeks, having broth for breakfast, fat bacon for dinner, and bread and milk for tea!!  He reported back to his unit - 4th Res. R.W.F. and was given the number 12760, which was later changed to 203360.  His further training included shooting practice on Talacre Sands, Prestatyn.  Then a number of men were required to train as signallers, so he and his pal J.E.Pugh volunteered.  (Pugh had joined the same day as John and had also been on working furlough).  
Training took six months and the following Morse Code was never forgotten:-
      A.- ; B -…; C -.-.; D -..; E .; F..-; G --.; H….;  I..;  J---; K -.-; L -..;  M --; N-.; O---; P--; Q--.-; R .-.; S…; T-; U..-;V…-; W.--; X-..-; Y-.--; Z --..:
      This Code had been invented by a Mr Morse, and was used officially for sending messages until about 1996.  At the time it was a very advanced technique, and John must have been very proud of his prowess.
      Another draft leave was granted before the day arrived to march behind the band to Oswestry Station bound for an unknown destination.  Would it be the battlefields of Belgium where so many of his fellow countrymen had died?   They arrived at Southampton and boarded a paddle steamer for France.  They arrived at La Harve and stayed there for two or three days.  Then they were put in to luggage trucks to cross France to Marseilles. They sighed a sigh of relief when they realised they were not going to the Western Front.  But where were they going?   Pugh developed measles and had to stay in hospital in France, but John was marched onto an Ex German boat called the Hunsspil, and it sailed eastward along the Mediterranean.   One night it collided with another ship, and had to be towed into Malta harbour for repairs which took a week to complete.  It then sailed into Milo harbour for a short spell before travelling westward via several islands to their final destination - Salonika in Greece.  The journey had taken about a month, and although John was very sea sick in the English Channel he was not sick again. However the journey across France was very miserable; packed into the luggage vans the men had great difficulty lying down to sleep.
 The Forgotten Army in Salonika.    
         When the party reached Salonika they were marched up country to a canvas camp called Summer Hill. The 11th R.W.F. Commanding Officer was Lt. Col. Yateman; and Gen. Duncan was in Charge of the 22nd Division. Whilst there they experienced a severe blizzard and the snow, ice, frost and wind broke tent ropes on many of the tents.  The Severn Valley seemed a long way away!
          A few days later, John and his pals were marched several miles to the Front Line to fight the Bulgarians.  It was trench warfare; our trenches on hills much smaller than the enemy’s.  The allied fronts were called Vardar, Struma and Doiran respectively; and John was positioned on the Dorain front - Doiran Lake lay before him to the right, and the enemy lines on the Grande Courone were directly in front.
           For a time John was in the front line manning the trenches. At night, he repaired the barbed wire entanglements which had been damaged by enemy shells. In addition to the shells and bullets there were rats, lice and mosquitoes to contend with! Later he was attached to the Company’s signal section.  The men would go out in pairs to man a mud hut in the front line.  The Company did a fortnight in the line and a fortnight behind the lines. 
           In Mid Summer 1918 John became ill, and when the time to change over came he requested permission to accompany those leaving in advance of the main unit.  It was a long walk, and the illness became worse during training behind the lines. He felt neglected as malaria and dysentery gradually took over, and he became unconscious before reaching the Australian Base Hospital in Northern Greece!  After hospital treatment - mainly quinine – he recovered, but dysentery left him with a damaged bowel. For that, and the after effects of malaria he later received a small army pension. He rejoined his unit (11th Bat. R.W.F.) at Stavross on the South coast of Greece.  Later, the unit was shipped to Dedigatch, which was then on the South coast of Bulgaria.  The landing was by raft and swimming ashore; rations were scarce - water soaked biscuits were the only food.
           The plan was to march against the Turks, but before this could happen they surrendered – 30th Sept 1918. The unit was then marched many miles back to the Doiran Front in Greece, to do odd jobs and patrol the line. The Bulgarians had also surrendered.  During this time John said that he trusted the Bulgarians who were his enemies, more that the Greeks who were supposed to be allies! 
            John had been on this Front for about 12 months, when all units were moved by rail from Kilendare station to Constantinople, to become the Army of the Black Sea.  Fourteen officers and 317 other ranks were marched from Stanbul, over the Galita Bridge, to Tashkishla Barracks.   This was a large old military building made up of barracks surrounding a large parade square.   It was said that this place had housed prisoners during the war. The rooms were large and high, with 10ft square pillars supporting the ceiling.  The pillars had long cracks in them which by day were filled with bugs; these bugs were also in the beds and blankets!  The soldiers prized the bugs out of the pillars with their bayonets, and sprinkled them and the beds with Keeting powder every night before going to bed.   John spent his 21st Birthday in this hell hole!
         About quarter of a mile away, on the shores of the Bosphorus was the Sultan’s Palace.  John did guard duty here and also on Galeta Quay, A.D.A. Sigs., and the Garrison Cells.  Later on he was put in charge of the training of six signalers, and they operated on various buildings in the city, signaling to one another.
         Life was beginning to improve, (although it took years to get over the effects of malaria,) and when John came first in a regimental run he was sent for training to Bukdery on the Bospherous.  The area sports were held over the Bospherous in Asia Minor, but although the prize was a home posting John did not manage to win his race!
         Later the unit was moved to be under canvas in Asia Minor, on the shores of the Sea of Marmara.  The men were able to bathe here, and on one occasion John very nearly drowned; only managing to save himself by finding a jetty post which helped him reach the surface!
          In 1919, after a year in Turkey, and a total of two years abroad, John returned home. (His pal, Pugh, had contracted measles on the way out to Salonika, and never reached Turkey, he had ended up in Greece with the 11th R.W.F.)    He travelled by boat to S.France; crossed France by train to Calais and by ship to Dover. Eventually he arrived at Prees Heath railway station on his way to Oswestry for demob.   He changed trains, and then popped for a cup of tea.  The train pulled off without him, and away went all his kit and trophies which he had brought for his relatives and friends, never to be seen again. He was heart broken.   He was transferred to the Army Reserve on 13th Dec 1919, attached to the 7th South Wales Borderers, (before that he had been attached to the 2nd East Surreys.) He was finally released from service on 9th Jan 1920, having served for exactly three years, and eventually returned home to Llandinam. By then all the celebrations and parties linked with the Armistice of 11th November 1918 were over. It was not until March 11th 1925 that the people of Llandinam showed their appreciation of his war service by presenting him with testimonial which read:-
         “To L/Cpl J. Jones of the Parish of Llandinam by his fellow parishioners as a slight tribute of their great admiration and deepest gratitude for the courage and devotion displayed by him in serving his King and Country in the Great War 1914 – 1919”.
	Unemployment was rampant. He was given a weekly pension of 8/- for 12 months, and 5/- for 6 months.  Desperately, he had to start looking for a job, but most of them had been taken by the soldiers who had returned earlier!  Eventually, he was lucky to get a job as green house gardener at Bronwylfa Hall, Wrexham, working for Sir Edmund Bushby.      After working there was about a week he was told he had been appointed as a constable with the Flintshire Constabulary.  He gave in his notice to the head gardener, and returned home before reporting for duty at Mold police station on Apl 1st 1920! He served in the Flintshire force until his retirement in 1953."

This was a large property and the American army requisitioned the barn for sleeping quarters for enlisted men, and several bedrooms in the main residence for officers. In my great grandmother&#039;s diary, I find her notes about the &quot;yanks&quot; who stayed for weeks and months. She seemed very fond of several of them, cooked French meals for them, and her daughter Marguerite attempted to teach them French. Her comments regarding her &quot;Yanks&quot; are so humorous. For example:  
&quot;While they incessantly chew that atrocious gum and put their feet on the table, my Yanks are such a joy. Always cheerful in spite of these horrible circumstances  so far away from home, some look like little boys, still so young and they sure love my food.&quot; On another note she mentions that her daughter Marguerite, 19 yrs old at the time, &quot;spends a lot of time in the orchard teaching French to the Yanks&quot;. Marguerite fell in love with an officer from California and married him after the war. When she followed him to America, it broke her mother&#039;s heart.

According to his war diary, John Bennington Breed arrived in Le Havre on 30th January 1917 with the Royal Garrison Artillery, 236th Siege Battery. He kept a daily diary of his experiences, including on every page how many shells were fired every day as he was in charge of armaments.
He talks about the gas and the planes and airships going over and talks about shooting them down. He was killed on 31st July 1917 - after he had made a last entry in his diary at around 9pm. He was 35 when he was killed. 
He is presumed to have joined earlier due to his age. It is likely that he enrolled around 1915 as his training diary is dated 1915-16 and includes lots of drawings of guns, ammunitions and instructions for firing distances.
He was a Second Lieutenant when he died. A memorial service was held in York on the 12th November, 1921 at Elmfield College York. 
A memorial card shows that he was buried in Klein Vierstarrt Cemetery, South West of Ypres. He left three children of which the contributor's mother was the middle one, aged seven when he died.

The diary makes sad reading due to the references to people getting killed and gassed. Occasionally he got a weekend off in a local town for rest and recouperation. In one exert the general tells them off for shooting when he was passing on his horse and he intends to report them. John Breed wrote that he would tell someone first.

104487,en,"Some years ago my parents died and after my father’s death I cleared his house, put it up for sale and gathered together box after box of family photographs, old newspaper cuttings, letters and the like. For the past 5 or 6 years they have lain jumbled up in a wardrobe in our spare room and my task for the next few months is to sort them out. I’ve looked at them many times and marvelled at the social history there is – many of the photographs and objects dating back a century. There are also faded photographs of days out I can remember as a child or people who I do not know, sitting on beaches or gazing into the camera.

Of all the items, however, there are a number relating to my grandfather, Joe, which I find poignant and exciting. He died in 1953 when I was eight and I only have vague memories of him. I don’t have any great emotional feelings about the items I’m just interested and moved by the social history they display.

I grew up in Preston in Lancashire and lived, until I came to Nottingham (to teacher training college) aged about twenty, in a two up two down terraced house. It was a very humble background. My grandfather, Joseph Derbyshire, lived in  a similar house in the next street. He had lived there all his life from when he married in the early years of the century. He spent most of his working life as journeyman property repairer  and builder – never owning his own business and always, I think being strapped for cash. Like many others of his generation he was, of course, a victim of the great depression of the 30s and lived through two wars. Additionally, his wife, my grandmother,  died in childbirth in the early 30s and he struggled to bring up 5 small children – one of them my mother. All this I knew. But when I began rummaging through the boxes I found one or two items that immediately brought a link with him.

So, what did I find. Well, there were numerous postcards each with a little popular verse  - I’ve seen their like before on the 'Antiques Roadshow' - but these were personal they were from my grandfather to my grandmother and vice versa. They were written during the Great War when  he was in France 'doing his bit.' They are brief but poignant. They mention 'little Albert' – the oldest of his children – just starting to walk, they tell of Janey thinking of her husband every night and praying for his safety and wondering if he has a bed to sleep on. They tell of him 'coming home soon on leave'. Many of his have no message apart from 'To my dear Janey'  - I understand that serving soldiers were often not allowed to write messages in case it gave anything away to the enemy so Janey had to simply look at the picture and at least know that he was still alive.

As I looked at them I reflected upon how different things are today – e-mail, mobile phones and the like – and indeed society’s expectations would not tolerate such a position. But in those days families just accepted this and kept a stiff upper lip. I thought, too, about what it must have meant to Joe and Janey (and millions like them) when he went off to France – a place which to them must have seemed as far away as the moon is to us. A completely unknown world for ordinary people who rarely travelled from their home town.

Also in the box were many faded sepia photographs of Joe with Janey and his brothers  - all standing proudly posing in their uniforms – ready to march off to war or return to the battle field after leave. There were other photographs too – showing Joe standing with his comrades – all to attention in their camp  at the front. And with these were pictures of him sitting with nurses and other wounded soldiers. And finally a lovely sketch of a rather grand building and scribbled on the back 'the hospital where I was treated for my wounds'. My grandfather was always a quite a good drawer - I can remember as small  boy sitting drawing with him.

But the things that pulled all these together and have given me much food for thought were two handwritten letters. One is a page obviously torn from an exercise book and written in green ink – in a beautiful copperplate hand. The other is an exact copy – dated the day afterwards (March 26th 1919). The first letter is a draft and has some  blanks where he has left  spaces  to put in bits of factual information – his army number, a date etc. The second is a final copy which  he obviously copied out the day afterwards. Presumably, there must have been a third copy which he sent. The letter is a begging letter – a plea from a desperate man to the war commissioners in Chelsea for an increase in his war pension so that he can support his family. His pension had been granted at the beginning of March and he was writing at the end of March so he was obviously anxious to improve his award - perhaps they were desperate for food, perhaps the workhouse beckoned. I say that it is an exact copy. This is not strictly true. The first draft says that his wife - Janey - is suffering from a 'nervous breakdown' but by the time that he does the copy on the following day he has changed this to a 'serious illness' and he says 'she is not strong'. For whatever reason he felt that it was not appropriate to use the term 'nervous breakdown' - I wonder why? Stigma? 'Serious illness' sounds more dramatic? Perhaps Janey didn't want to admit her condition. In the end it doesn't really matter but I can understand his anxiety. 

I have to confess, that although I have no great emotional bond with my grandfather or indeed my family as a whole, whenever I read the letter I get a lump in my throat. He was a very ordinary man of little schooling. By trade a journeyman whitesmith (a worker in tin and pewter). He lived in a tiny house with no hot water or bathroom. He had a beautiful handwriting style and his use of English was impeccable. He was sent off to a far off country to fight in a war that was not of his making, was wounded on two occasions and returned to his country not as a hero (except perhaps to his wife and his neighbours) but had to beg for more money from the government because the injuries he had sustained meant, as he says, that 'I shall be handicapped while ever I live.'

So, what did the letter say? (I copy exactly as he wrote):

Gentlemen,
I  Joseph Derbyshire of 5 Rigby Street, Preston, Lancashire most humbly petition you to review my pension of eight shillings and threepence (8/3)per week granted to me on the 7/3/19 for twelve months, for the wounds which I received in action during the war.

I don't think this amount satisfactory and I think that you will agree with me when I tell you that I have a Wife (who is suffering from a serious illness and she is not strong) and a Child who is three years old depending on me and I cannot yet follow any employment and particularly my own trade that of a journeyman Black and White smith nor do I think I shall ever be able to do the same at my work as I did before the war.

My Regimental address was 23807 Pte. Joseph Derbyshire, 9th Batt. Loyal North Lancs Regt. and I was wounded through the chest and lungs on the 21st Oct.  1916 and I was in Hospital six months  before I recovered. Shortly after this I was suffering from dysentery and had to be sent home on the 12th Sept. 1917 to recuperate. I was again wounded on the 27th May 1918 and taken prisoner with a broken leg. Through some cause or other this leg is now shorter that the other and as my work demands me to be on my feet most of the time I shall be handicapped while ever I live.

Hoping this will receive your best attention .
I remain,
Yours humbly
Joseph Derbyshire

As I read the letter I pictured him in my mind’s eye sitting, all those years ago, carefully scribing his letter. I remembered that he died at 61 – a remarkably young age and I always remember him looking an old man. Indeed I have a photo of him sitting on his back door step with me – it must have been shortly before he died. He looked far older than his 60 years. He had had a very hard life. And I wonder what it must have 'cost' him – to write a begging letter. Today we would not tolerate a pension for war wounds that was only for 12 months. Today our expectations would quite rightly be so different. Would I have written such a humble, polite letter - I think not! (although I sense in it a bit of  'steel' when he uses phrases like 'I think that you will agree with me'). I also remember that he always walked with a pronounced limp – perhaps a left over from his broken leg.


And as I read the pages and looked at the creased  sepia photographs, I thought too how my grandfather could never in his wildest dreams have imagined that night in March 1919 when he sat down to write his letter that almost a hundred years later his grandson would take his scribbling which have somehow survived the years and the photos of him standing proudly in his uniform and scan them into a computer (what would he have made of that!). And then 'publish' his words on something called the internet so that they could be instantly read by everyone on the planet – should they choose to look. What a very long way we have come with our technology – but  our leaders still send young men off to war and then wring their hands when a young soldier is killed. Our morals and ethics lag far behind our technology.

But, personal prejudices aside, in sorting out my box I felt that I had somehow fleetingly touched the past."
118664,en,"Edward Joseph Murray was born in 1895 and volunteered for service in 1915. He joined the Cameron Highland Regiment. The family do not know much about his time in the army, but it is believed he was involved in the battles of Passchendaele, Somme and Loos and that he was a stretcher bearer at some point. Towards the end of the war, some time in 1918, Murray was taken prisoner and spent the rest of the war in a German prisoner of war camp, possibly in the Wurtenburg area. After the war he returned to Endinburgh and resumed his work in the civil service. He married in the late 1920s. His son (the father of the contributor) was born in 1934 and was never told much about his father's time in the army.

Schülz asks about Murray's life after the war, and describes his own situation.

The family moved from Co Wicklow to the Sandymount area of Dublin in the early 1900s, and according to the 1911 census Joseph was a bread van driver. A newspaper piece around the time of his death described him as having been a drill instructor with the Loyal Dublin Volunteers, before enlisting in the RIF.

Joseph (service number 13492) volunteered for the 9th Battalion of the Royal Iniskilling Fusiliers, which was formed in September 1914. He was promoted to Lieutenant Corporal on 9th October that year. Following training first in Ireland and then England, the Battalion disembarked in Boulogne, France on 5 October 1915. The Battalion did not see front line service up to the end of 1915, and February 1916 was the first time they were &quot;in the line&quot; near Beaumont Hamel. On 17th March 1916 (St Patrick&#039;s Day), everyone wore the shamrock which had been sent out. Two days later Joseph Bayle was wounded by shellfire while posting sentries in a thicket. He died of his wounds aged 27, near Doullens, on 21 March 1916. He is buried at Gezaincourt Communal Cemetery, in Grave A9.

His regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#039;s Own) commenced another attack against powerful German defences. Part of this advance was held up by machine gun fire during which time all the officers became casualties and, as happens on most like occasions because of such loss of leadership, confusion reigned and retirement, the usual course of action, would probably have occurred. However, Private Edwards, grasping the situation and on his own initiative dashed out towards the machine gun which he knocked out with his hand grenades. This very brave act, coupled with great presence of mind and total disregard of personal danger made further advance possible and cleared up a dangerous situation.

It is possible that, as an Irishman, his service in the British Army, like many others was not viewed with favour by the new Republic and consequently he seems to have settled in London.  However, later in life he was forced to sell his medal to make ends meet.

119507,en,"Dr. Eugene Clarence (E.C.) Warriner (1866-1945) was a well respected educator in the state of Michigan, United States.  After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1891, Warriner served for over 20 years in the Saginaw, MI School System.   In 1918, Warriner became the fourth President of Central State Normal School (which later became “Central Michigan University”) in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.  Presiding over the college during the difficult years of World War I, Warriner remained a steadfast advocate for peace.  He believed that public education was essential to realizing the goals of the peace movement and accordingly organized and presided over the Michigan branch of the American School Peace League which was founded in Bay City, Michigan in 1910. During his career, Warriner gave a number of speeches to teachers and students on peace, international arbitration and international law. These speeches are held by the Clarke historical library at Central Michigan University.

Document 1 titled 'Universal Peace and the School' :
The precise date is unknown, but it was likely written around 1911 when Warriner became more involved with the Michigan Branch of the American School Peace League (which was established in October 1910). No mention of the war is made in the speech, but the speech is interesting as a complement to Documents 3 (Speech on Patriotism) and 4 (Letter from Hyman Herman).  
Taken as a whole - Documents 1 (Universal Peace and the School) , 3 (Speech on Patriotism) and 4 (Letter from Hyman Herman) illustrate how Warriner’s thinking about patriotism, citizenship and the duty of the teacher shifts after World War 1 begins. 
In Document 1 (Universal Peace and the School), teachers are exhorted to engage in a “warfare against war” and are told that “the teacher’s part in this warfare against war is to create a humble sentiment against war as a means of settling controversial disputes”.  This claim is rather different than the discussion of the teacher’s duty in Document 3 (which was written in 1915 - after the beginning of World War I, but prior to the U.S. entry to the war).  A theory of war is provided according to which man’s instincts for acquisitiveness (the desire of possession) and pugnacity (the impulse to strike at a foe) are the primary culprits.  Civilization is defined as a taming of these instincts."

Formerly of the Bedfordshire Imperial Yeomanry with whom he served for eight years, he registered for National Reserve on the 29th January 1914 subsequently being sent to Remounts, France before allocation to the 5th Royal Irish Lancers.
On 28th / 29th November 1917 at Bourlon Wood, France, Private Clare, now a stretcher-bearer, dressed wounds and brought the wounded to the regiment&#039;s dressing station under most intense fire. At one period, when all the garrison of a detached post had become casualties he crossed to them through very heavy fire and, having dressed all the cases, manned the post single-handed until a relief could be sent. Then, after carrying a seriously wounded man through intense fire to the dressing station, he went, still under heavy fire, to every company post warning them that the enemy were using gas shells. Unfortunately this brave soldier was subsequently killed later during the day. He was aged 28.
His VC is publicly displayed at the The Queen&#039;s Royal Lancers Regimental Museum (Belvoir Castle, Lincolnshire, England). A stained glass window was placed in the south side of Chatteris parish church in his honour, depicting Christ rewarding a faithful soldier; it was dedicated in Sept 1918.

Both enlisted in September 1915. Neither were married and Peter had worked as a bank official prior to enlistment. 
Peter (known as Leo) was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment attached to the 3rd battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. He received officer training in London and was sent to France in November 1916.   His letters home from France describe playing sport behind the lines and how used he has become to the sound of the guns at nighttime. He describes the fun of the Brigades sports day during their period of rest and the &#039;extremely good music&#039;, remarking wryly that &#039;most people here thought on yesterday afternoon that this was a very fine war&#039;. The awareness of danger was however ever present and he mentions how glad he is that there is a Catholic chaplain with them to provide services before going into danger. In April 1917 he was hospitalized for scabies and was due to be sent home but the hospital ships were cancelled and he remained in France. A month later Peter was dead. He was killed at the Battle of the Arras on the 19th May 1917 on the Western Front. He was aged twenty-eight. His final letter, collected here, was dated 13th May 1917, less than a week before his death, making it particularly poignant, especially his closing promise to write again at the first opportunity. Peter is commemorated on the Arras memorial in France. 

His brother Christopher served with the Royal Flying Corps during the war. He enlisted at the age of twenty-one. He was based in France during the war, and his letter in this collection is written to his brother Jim who was back in Ireland. His letter suggests he missed home, evident by his desire for ‘all the local news’. Peter and Christopher were located less than 40 miles apart in France in May 1917 and had made plans to meet just before Peter&#039;s death. After the war Christopher left Ireland and moved to Rhodesia where he joined the police force. He did not return to Ireland except for a brief visit in 1939. 

The war story of Peter and Christopher was passed down through the family and his relatives found Peter&#039;s photograph a few years ago, making the story more real to them. They were recently invited to a ceremony at the Arras memorial in France."

On 16 April 1918 near Boisieux St. Marc, France, it was necessary for information to be obtained from the front line and the only way to get it was over ground with no cover and in full view of the enemy. A small party tried without success, followed by six men, singly, each one being killed in the attempt. Private Counter then volunteered and, going out under terrific fire, got through and returned with vital information which enabled his commanding officer to organise and launch the final successful counter-attack. Subsequently he also carried five messages across the open under heavy artillery barrage to company headquarters.

November 1914 his ship was visiting the German concessionary port of Tsingtau, China when Japan declared war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. The ship was scuttled and its crew captured, along with numerous German naval personnel. These prisoners of war were taken to Japan and held in various camps until 1920-21, after their imperial governments at home had ceased to exist. Japan honored international standards for care of POWs during World War I, as photos from Rogulj's personal collection show. Scenes of barracks, exercises, entertainments, sports, holiday celebrations (attended by Japanese officers), and funerals suggest that treatment of German and Austro-Hungarian captives was humane, if not completely joyful. Inspection reports by neutral inspectors confirmed this. Repatriation was delayed after 1918 until international funds for transport could be arranged.

He had lots of Daily Mail postcards and bought lots of books of cards after the war. We think he came home after the war in 1919, as his attestation papers suggest this.
I always remember him retired in the 1940s. He received an ex-serviceman's house in Killester on the Howth Road in Dublin, Ireland. I'm not sure if he ever worked again. My best memory of him is him doing the gardening. My mother would have been 8 in 1916 during the Easter Rising, when she had to get across the city from Howth to Rathmines in Dublin.He died in the 1960s"

Editor's comment:
SHELL: In 1915 Britain acquired a number of ""autocanon de 75 mm mle 1913"" anti-aircraft guns, as a stopgap measure while it developed its own anti-aircraft alternatives. They were used in the defence of Britain, usually mounted on de Dion motor lorries using the French mounting which the British referred to as the ""Breech Trunnion"". Britain also purchased a number of the standard 75 mm guns and adapted them for AA use using a Coventry Ordnance Works mounting, the ""Centre Trunnion"". At the Armistice there were 29 guns in service in Britain.
The head stamps on the case should confirm which factory. ""FN"" on a French 75mm indicates that the case was made by the Fonderie Nationale de Nanterre. So the shell was (likely) made in Nantere and was probably fired from a British adapted mount in the AA role.
PHOTO: There is no obvious way to identify a random WW1 British serviceman from a photo unless there are other clues from uniform, badges and captions. In this instance all that helps is the Royal Marine Artillery connection (His hat badge is that of the RMA). Worth trying RM museum at Portsmouth maybe - but an extremely long shot unless they happen to have another photo of the same man, or a captioned version of this one."

2nd Lt Alfred Boxall
MC RE

 

1886-1917 


Alfred Boxall was born on the 15th of July 1886 at 21 Melrose Gardens, Hammersmith, London. His father George was born in 1845 in Westminster and his occupation is listed as a cashier on Alfred’s birth certificate. His mother Charlotte (née Lingard) was born in 1858 in Pimlico, London .

In the 1891 census Alfred is not living with his family who are still at 21 Melrose Gardens. His father George’s occupation is a Railway Clerk/Cashier for Great Western Railways (GWR). There are three children on the census: Bertha aged 10, George Frederick aged 6. For some reason Charlotte is not at home on the night the census was taken, it could be that she was ill or visiting family . 

In 1891 Alfred was living in the Kensington &amp; Chelsea District Branch School at Marlesford Lodge, 253 Kings Street in Hammersmith . The 1834 Poor Law Act led to improvements in the arrangements made for the education of pauper children. Poor Law Unions, and parishes regulated by local acts, were persuaded to establish schools and to appoint schoolmasters. The policy of separating the children from their parents (who were generally considered to be a bad influence on their children) and sending them, if possible, to the country was continued The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1844 made possible a further development in this field which was of significance for the metropolitan area. Unions and parishes were empowered to unite and to form a School District which then set up a large separate school for the education of all the indoor pauper children of the constituents of the district. These were usually industrial schools where both boys and girls were taught the basics of a useful trade which, it was hoped, would provide them with better prospects in future.
 
Kensington and Chelsea School District was founded in 1876, comprising the Poor Law Unions of Kensington and Chelsea. The School District decided not to construct a large district school, instead establishing a cottage homes development at Banstead in Surrey. This took the form of small houses reminiscent of a family home, with separate school buildings, workshops and recreation facilities. 
A branch school, Marlesford Lodge, was constructed in Hammersmith. Marlesford Lodge &quot;intermediate&quot; school opened in 1883 at a site on King&#039;s Street in Hammersmith, opposite the southern end of Ravenscourt Park. It accommodated around 132 children. This acted as a &#039;filter school&#039;, preventing unsuitable children from being transferred to the Banstead Homes, such those with parents in custody, those with infectious ailments and those under the age of 4 and also to minimise the time children spent in the main workhouse — any child admitted to the workhouse before 2pm was washed and despatched to Marlesford the same afternoon . It dealt with:
•	&quot;Ins-and-Outs&quot;
•	Children of parents in custody
•	Those suffering from slight non-infectious ailments ( Alfred had Mumps and hearing loss)
•	Those awaiting transfer to Banstead, including those falling below its minimum admission age of four
 
The site later became a home for &#039;mentally defective&#039; children. In more recent times, the property became known as Palingswick House, accommodating a library and museum, and also housing a number of charities. In 2012, the site was sold to the West London Free School.
Alfred may have been ill when he was a pupil in the school. When he tried to join the army in 1914 he was rejected due to hearing loss. Mumps or measles as a child could have caused this and if he had an infectious disease this would explain why he was in the district school.
In 1901 the Boxall family are back together and living at 73 Brook Green in Hammersmith.  George Boxall is still in his occupation as a cashier for GWR and both his brothers William and George Frederick are bank clerks. His sister Bertha is a twenty year old art student. So in ten years the Boxall family have gone from sending their youngest son to a workhouse school to being able to send their daughter to art school. Alfred attended the Godolphin School in Hammersmith (which became an all girls school in 1905 and renamed the Godolphin &amp; Latymer School) before transferring to the Merchant Taylors School (which he attended 1900-03) . The School has enjoyed a distinguished history since its foundation in 1561 by the Merchant Taylors’ Company. One of the nine original Public Schools as defined by the 1868 Act   
He obtained his 3rd Class BSc degree in Engineering from the University of London in 1907  having studied at South Western Polytechnic Engineering College in Chelsea. Founded in 1895, one of the principal aims of South-Western Polytechnic Institute was the provision of education for the poorer inhabitants of London. The Institute offered well-equipped laboratories for the study of subjects such as mechanical and electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry and metallurgy, in the hope of attracting male students keen to learn a trade and enter industry. In 1922, South-Western Polytechnic Institute evolved into Chelsea Polytechnic, which became Chelsea College of Science and Technology, before becoming a designated school of the University of London in 1971. Existing Chelsea students and courses were transferred to King’s College in 1985.  On graduation in 1907 he joined the Great Western Railway Company (GWR).
 
In 1911, according to the census, Alfred is a Civil Engineer working for GWR and is still living at 73 Brook Green with his parents and his brother George who is an Electrical Engineer, also with GWR. George senior has now retired as Chief Cashier of GWR . Alfred’s brother and sister (William and Bertha) are living at 98 Fillebrook Road, Leytonstone, Essex with William being a dental surgeon with two servants and Bertha with no employment noted . So another ten years have passed and all of George’s children are professionals. 
On Saturday 11th of March 1911 Alfred played in a football match for Shrewsbury D.E.O. against Wolverhampton D.E.O of the GWR. “The match was finely contested and resulted in a draw 1-1. At the Close of the match tea was provided and Mr Woodward (divisional engineer, Shrewsbury) presided over the subsequent smoking concert, to which the following contributed; Messrs. Boxall,.....”  The following year Shrewsbury won 2-0 and Alfred is mentioned as a singer in the smoking concert which followed the game.  On the 24th of April Alfred passed a signalling exam in Birmingham with 419 marks. 
Sometime before 1917 George senior, Charlotte, and Alfred have moved into 98 Fillebrook Road as this is address on Alfred’s attestation papers .
Alfred was commissioned as a Temporary Second Lieutenant in the 262nd Railway Company, Royal Engineers on 3rd of February 1917, although it is was not Gazetted but marked as “On Probation”.   .
 
The contribution to the war effort, especially on the Western Front, of the designated Railway Construction Companies of the Royal Engineers is largely overlooked and/or not researched in most accounts of the conflict. Given the fact that the earliest troop movements gave rise to the phrase &quot;war by timetable&quot; and that the railway was the primary means of movement of men, munitions and supplies, the important if unglamorous role of this military function cannot be underestimated. 

Very large numbers of the employees of British railway companies were then volunteering for military service and the men for RE Railway units were selected from them. By the end of 1917, out of 180,000 enlistments from English railway companies, about 40,000 were serving in RE Railway units.
The HQ of the regular railway troops before the war was at Longmoor in Hampshire, nearly 1,700 officers and 66,000 other ranks were sent overseas from this centre. Approximately half the officers for the new units were provided by the British railway companies on the recommendation of the Railway Executive Committee and the other half were mainly men from overseas who had been employed on colonial and foreign railways. 
Once in France, the sappers would be assigned to a Construction Train, of which there were eight in operation in mid-1915. Each Construction Train would have a complement of up to two complete Railway Companies, with a Captain as officer commanding the train. This enabled the sappers to carry both themselves and all their necessary tools and equipment to and from wherever the next work was required. The Companies would pitch tents for accommodation, as required. Large-scale work would include the construction of the major stores and ammunition dump at Audruicq, ten miles from Calais. Here, and at numerous other locations such as the nearby major ammunition dump at Zeneghem Yard, there was great use of Chinese Labour and R.E. Labour Companies to prepare the ground, ready for the platelaying sappers.
As the various campaigns and battles unfolded, RE Railway Companies were engaged all over the British sector, close examination of the period maps bear testimony to miles of what was to be temporary track that criss-crossed the area. Howitzer Spurs, Ambulance Train Sidings, Tank Enablements and bridges were all constructed, in addition to the constant maintenance and line doubling. Work in progress was always a potential target for enemy artillery and also there were the attentions of the German Air Force to contend with.
 

A primary objective was always to take standard gauge railways as close to the front as possible, to lessen the demands on light railway systems, horsed transport and manpower. For the sappers, work could mean toiling around the clock, especially where lines had been cut by shellfire. Inevitably there were casualties; analysis of the records shows that 173 men from Railway Companies lost their lives. The Railway Companies gradually began to be demobilised and by August 1919 the last Company had laid its last sleeper.
The 262nd Railway Company was the third of such companies made up from men of the GWR (Great Western Railway) in February. The formation is report as follows:
“During the last few weeks, at the request of the War Office, another complete Great Western Railway Construction Company, Royal Engineers, to be known as the 262nd Company, was raised. The Company consist of 1 draughtsman, 2 clerks, 200 platelayers, 20 carpenters, 7 masons and bricklayers, 10 blacksmiths, 5 strikers, 5 fitters, and 2 cooks. The following have been given commissions in this company:-
Mr O.T. Wood, chief assistant to the divisional engineer, Paddington, as Captain.
Mr F.G. Price, of the divisional engineer’s office, Paddington, and Mr A. Boxall, of the Divisional engineer’s office, Shrewsbury, as Second Lieutenants.
The men are now in camp undergoing training for service overseas.” 
 The War Diary reports:
“On the 26th of February 1917 the Company left Longmoor at 7AM having marched from billets at Greatham where the greater part of the unit arrived in civilian clothes, the unit went overseas six men understrength. The following were the names of the officers: Capt G S Hasell in command, Capt D T Wood, 2 Lieuts R. Gibb, S J Askham, F G Price, A Boxall.
The Company having left Southampton at 9PM 26-2-17 on the SS “Caeserea”, landed at Le Harve at 5PM 27-2-17. Departed Le Harve at 2AM 3-3-17 the unit detrained at Bailleul and was accommodated in billets near Dranoutre where they were employed on constructing the “Clapham Junction to Bruloose Line”
On the 8th of March (No.3 Platoon, under Lt Boxall), detachment of one officer and thirty other ranks left for Poperinghe where they were engaged in maintaining lines in the Ypres Salient and constructing a subsidiary Railway Stores Park at Railhoek. A further detachment  of 19 men left for Poperinghe on the 17th of March (meaning Alfred had 49 men under his command)” 
In May 1917 they were in the Brandhoek area, getting ready for the push on Ypres and were living in a special train of 27 wagons instead of tents, often &quot;visited&quot; by Richthofen and his circus. 

The War Diary continues:
 “During this month (June) A Boxall awarded the MC and Sgt Greening the MM for work in the Ypres Gun Spur.
On the 25th of October No 3 Railway Wood howitzer spur and No 2 spur Ravine Wood ready for use. Also earthworks for No Man’s Land Station on the Roulers Line (from Hell Fire Corner) was begun. During this month (October) ii LT BOXALL Killed” 
The unit moved around quite a bit, charged with pushing new railway lines down to the new casualty clearing stations and gun being set up in the summer months in preparation for the Passchendaele Offensive. Medical units nicknamed as Dosinghem, Bandaghem and Mendinghem, as well as GodWearsVelvet, are mentioned in the diary. The diary says that when he was hit by enemy shellfire, he was engaged in laying railway lines from Hellfire Corner out into No Man&#039;s Land . At one point he is working about 600 yards from Hellfire Corner. 
2nd Lt Alfred Boxall RE died of his wounds on the 25th of October 1917  at the 2nd Australian Field Ambulance BEF (1st Australian Division)  in Ypres in France . He was 31. At the time of his death his parents, George and Charlotte Boxall, were living at 98 Fillebrook Road.   A report in The Railway Magazine, Vol 42 Jan-Mar 1918 said:
 

This report also appeared in the Great Western Railway Magazine:
 
He was buried at Asylum British Cemetery, Ypres , which was established in the grounds of a mental hospital (the Hospice du Sacre Coeur) a little West of the railway station, between the Poperinghe road and the railway. It was used by Field Ambulances and fighting units from February 1915, to November 1917, and it contained the graves of 265 soldiers from the United Kingdom. 
After the war he was removed and buried in the Bedford House Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery outside Ieper (Ypres), West-Vlaanderen, Belgium in Enclosure No. 2, Section IV, Row A, Grave 6. His entry on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission says that his parents were living at 81 Wallwood Rd., Leytonstone, London by the time he was reburied. Enclosure No.2 was begun in December 1915, and used until October 1918. After the Armistice, 437 graves were added, all but four of which came from the Ecole de Bienfaisance and Asylum British Cemeteries, at Ypres. 
 
Bedford House Cemetery is located 2.5 Km south of Ieper town centre on the Rijselseweg (N336), the road connecting Ieper to Armentieres. Zillebeke village and most of the commune were in the hands of Commonwealth forces for the greater part of the First World War, but the number of cemeteries in the neighbourhood bears witness to the fierce fighting in the vicinity from 1914 to 1918.  Bedford House, sometimes known as Woodcote House, were the names given by the Army to the Chateau Rosendal, a country house in a small wooded park with moats. Although it never fell into German hands, the house and the trees were gradually destroyed by shell fire. It was used by field ambulances and as the headquarters of brigades and other fighting units, and charcoal pits were dug there from October 1917.In time, the property became largely covered by small cemeteries; five enclosures existed at the date of the Armistice, but the graves from No.1 were then removed to White House Cemetery, St. Jean, and those from No.5 to Aeroplane Cemetery, Ypres. 
 
In all, 5,139 Commonwealth servicemen of the First World War are buried or commemorated in the enclosures of Bedford House Cemetery. 3,011 of the burials are unidentified but special memorials commemorate a number of casualties known or believed to be buried among them. Other special memorials name casualties buried in other cemeteries whose graves could not be found on concentration. Second World War burials number 69 (3 of which are unidentified). There are 2 Germans buried here.
Alfred was not married at the time of his death and his estate and personal effects (his CO sent a brown suitcase of effects)  went to his father George. His estate was valued at £310 in 1918 or about £17,000 today. A lot of the pages in his service record are about the pay, allowances, and gratuity due to Alfred’s estate and the letters of administration. 
He had a bank account with army agents Cox &amp; Co of 18 Charing Cross, London.  who date back to 1758. The term Army Agent comes from the days when commissions were purchased and the agents handled the financial transactions involved. By 1914 they acted as any normal bank, but the majority of officers had their accounts with them since they understood the army way of life. Indeed, many wartime officers had not held a bank account and were encouraged to join Cox &amp; Co. The officer was regarded as a gentleman and his word was seen as his bond. Hence people trusted a cheque from an officer. To issue a dud or &#039;stumer&#039; cheque was a court-martial offence and during the war a not insignificant number of officers were tried for this. However, the firm did not just issue pay and manage officers’ bank accounts. Its Insurance Department could arrange to insure the officer’s kit; the Income Tax Department could deal with his tax returns; and the Standing Order Department would ensure that his tailor was paid regularly. Cox’s also sent a cashier with a supply of money to every hospital ship as it arrived, to enable wounded officers to cash cheques.
 
Alfred’s Obituary was published in the Taylorian from Merchant Taylor’s School. It Says:
“Second Lieutenant Alfred Boxall, R.E., was the youngest son of George and Charlotte Boxall, late of Hammersmith, and now of Leytonstone, and was 31 years of age. His education began at Goldophin School, Hammersmith, but on the dissolution of that school he transferred to Merchant Taylors’. He subsequently went through an engineering course of training at the South-Western Polytechnic, Manresa Road, Chelsea, and in 1908 obtained the degree of B.Sc. (Engineering) of the University of London. He then entered the service of the Great Western Railway Company in their Engineering Department, and became an assistant engineer in the Shrewsbury division of that company. Upon the outbreak of the war he offered his services, but was rejected on account of defective hearing. He was, however, subsequently appointed to a commission in a Railway Construction Company formed for service on France in February  last and killed instantaneous by a high explosive shell while in the discharge of his duty on October 25th last. He was universally liked by all who knew him, and his superior officers speak in the highest praise of his efficiency in the discharge of his duties in very trying conditions and of his popularity with the officers and men of his company.”  
On the 1st of January 1918 the Military Cross which Alfred was awarded was Gazetted.  The 262nd Railway Company’s war diary in June 1917 states that it was an immediate award for his work on the Ypres gun spur (i.e. laying railway lines to forward gun positions) during that month. You will see from the diary there are a remarkable number of awards in the field to both officers and men of the 262 Railway Company, which either means they had a CO who was free with his powers, or this was a little band of men required to make the impossible possible in the teeth of enemy shellfire; reading the war diary, it is hard not to conclude the latter scenario is the truth of the situation.  Despite research no citation has yet been found for his Military Cross. It is usually true to say that Military Crosses gazetted on 1st January will have been awarded for continuous courage over a period of time, rather than a single specific act of bravery, This takes nothing away from Alfred&#039;s earning of the award; the war diary speaks to the difficulty and danger of what was asked of him, and the magnificent job he made of it. 
Alfred’s Military Cross was handed to his father, George, by General Sir Francis Lloyd at a ceremony in the General Meeting Room at Paddington Station on Saturday, 23rd of February 1918. 
“Sir Francis pinned Military Medals to the breasts of seven Great Western men, whose conspicous gallantry and devotion to duty on the battlefield had won them these honours. Another Great Western man was congratulated upon having won the Distinguish Conduct Medal and to Mr George Boxall, the Company’s late chief cashier, was handed the Military Cross awarded to his son, who had been killed in action. The awards were to members of the G.W.R. Engineering Department attached to the 262nd (G.W.R.) Company, Royal Engineers. Sir Francis said that the men to whom the decorations were given belonged to a company that had done great work at the Front, almost in the firing lines at times, and under shell fire; and were part of a great railway company in this country that had had a large share in the war” 
 
 
  
Boxall Family – Epilogue
George Frederick Boxall was Alfred’s brother he was born on the 31st of July 1882    and in 1907 in the London Gazette as a postman  . He lived with his parents until he joined the Royal Engineers. He joined as a private and was promoted to Corporal, Sergeant, and received at commission to finish World War One as a Captain  service number 146835 . 
He served in the Royal North Signal Company &amp; L Signals Company Royal Engineers, part of XI Corps which was in the following locations:
Major Headquarters	Locations	Dates
Home Service
XI Corps	Southampton	Aug 1914
France and Flanders
XI Corps	Loos	25 Sep – 5 Oct 1915

XI Corps	Hazebrouck	12-15 Apr 1918
XI Corps	Bethune	18 Apr 1918
XI Corps	Pursuit to Mons	28 Sep – 11 Nov 1918 

 He relinquished his commission on the 18th of June 1919   
There is a possible marriage for him in Jul-Sep 1925 to a Miss Grimsdale.  He died in Swindon (home of the GWR) in July- Sep 1969 
Alfred’s brother William Francis Boxall was born Jul-Sep 1885  and also lived with his parents until at least 1901. William graduated as a Dental Surgeon from Guys Hospital Dental School in 1907 . He was gazetted as a Lieutenant on the 27th of May 1918 in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) , attaining the rank of Captain on the 27th of May 1919 . He did have a dental partnership until 1912. 

William committed suicide in June 1932; the Chelmsford Chronicle reported it on the 17th of June 1932 as follows:
 
Charlotte Boxall died aged 72 in Leytonstone on the 4th of September 1929
George Boxall Senior died aged 94 in Leytonstone on the 8th of May 1938. 
Bertha Boxall died aged 84 in Leytonstone in 1965  
William, Charlotte, and George are buried in Grave 97188, Square 179 in the City of London Cemetery in Palmers Green. George purchaed the plot on the 5th of September 1929. Bertha’s ashes were interred into the grave on the 25th of May 1965 . The registered owners of the grave were Bertha and George Frederick Boxall.
William had a son, Dr Peter Alfred Boxall, whoose children are Alfred’s only living relatives."
102084,en,"My grandfather, Dr. Paul Lernau, an ENT physician, was appointed director of a hospital in Glogau, Schlesia (today Glogow, Poland) for sick and injured German soldiers during WW1. I have three (family) photographs of the staff and patients of this hospital. I do not have the dates when these images were taken.

Dr. Lernau lived in Glogau from 1899 till his death in 1932. His wife, Gertrud Lernau, moved to Berlin and was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942. She survived the camp, and later emigrated to Israel. Their daughter Charlotte (later Sonia Preux) emigrated during WW2 to Mexico, and their son (my father) Hans Ludwig (later Hanan) Lernau emigrated in 1923 to Palestine.

Photo Hospital 1: Shows a group of patients standing on a flight of steps, probably outside the hospital. Every face is very clear and identifiable. Paul is standing in front with three nurses on each side. Two orderlies stand in the rear. Some patients have bandaged ears or throats.

Photo Hospital 2: Shows doctors and staff in a patients' room. Paul stands in the middle with the same 6 nurses around him. Two additional officers (?) stand on both sides. They might be physicians but they do not carry a red cross on their sleeve like Paul and the nurses. So they might have been administrators. There are patient beds behind the group, with patients' names inscribed. On the left there is one half-hidden patient in bed, looking into the camera as well. He is holding to his nose some instrument, probably a nebulizer (?).  Paul and the officers are in uniforms which might give a clue to their army units. The officer on the right and Paul have their swords.  The nurses were probably also residents of Glogau.

Photo Hospital 3: This photo is the most interesting one. It shows a Christmas celebration for staff and patients. It takes place inside a synagogue as can be recognized by the stars of David along the upper walls. There is an inscription ""Froehliche Weihnacht."" (Happy Christmas) attached to the curtain which covers the ark of the synagogue, and a Christmas tree stands to the left. There is not enough room along the long table in the middle, and some patients and staff and guests stand in the rear. There is not much food on the table other then apples (or potatoes?). Several patients are bandaged. Each of the seated patients has some kind of a roll in front of him, the purpose of which is not clear to me. It might contain a slip of paper which some of the patients hold in their hands. One can imagine that these papers contained songs or prayers for the celebration(?). At the end of the table stands a priest. Paul stands to his left. Gertrud Lernau, Paul's wife, in a black dress and a black hat, stands in the right rear with Charlotte her daughter in front of her. Hans Ludwig my father (born in 1902) sits on the fourth chair on the right side. Patients were hospitalized in this hall as can be recognized by the patients' beds on the rear on both sides. 
There was a large imposing synagogue in Glogau (burned down in 1938). Photographs of its interior do not fit the hall in this photo, which means that the celebration took place either in a secondary hall of the same synagogue, or in another one, about which I have no information. The combination of a patient ward inside a synagogue, with Christmas celebration, with priest and a Christmas tree - all this makes this image so special.

I am interested to get any information about the hospital, the staff members or the patients.

119485,en,"My grandfather, John (Jack) S. Lithgow was born around 1899-1900 in Scotland. When war broke out, he was studying at Hutchinson's Grammar School, a private school in Glasgow. His family were fairly affluent, Jack had 3 brothers and their father was an architect. His father had to give his permission to enable Jack to join up as he was underage. 
In October 1917, Jack was sent on a course to be trained in bombing. The note book he kept contains interesting notes, such as information on how a spade could be used as a weapon and diagrams of trenches showing that they had become quite sophisticated by then. The note book illustrates the sort of information being used to train soldiers and the degree of sophistication in what soldiers were being told. The tutor's note at the end of the diary 'very good work' suggests that Jack might have been better than average.

Jack went to Arras with B Regiment and survived the war. His father's business collapsed after the war (possibly due to rising labour costs with the shortage of men) and when Jack was demobilised, he did manual labour such as building roads and digging graves.

On one particular day I was asked to go to a house in Marston St Lawrence, between Banbury and Brackley to catalogue items from a recently deceased estate for a forthcoming sale. I was to meet a Mr Blencowe who would instruct me further.

On arrival at the very attractive cottage, I was greeted by Mr Blencowe, then in his 90s and was told that the family had originally lived in The Vicarage in Marston St Lawrence. The cottage being bought by the parents on their retirement. Mr Blencowe had had one brother Oswald but he had been killed in the Great War and, I think a sister and it was this sister who had recently died. Mr Blencowe was moving into sheltered housing and couldn&#039;t keep much in the way of possessions.

The house was a veritable treasure trove of late 19th and early 20th century artifacts as well as some older antiques. Much of it sentimental family items alluding to a busy, happy and tragic past. Among these items were three letters in a very battered and broken leather case. Dated 1916 and &quot;On Active Service&quot; boldly printed on the enveloped I couldn&#039;t help but have a closer look at them. They were all from Mr Blencowe&#039;s brother Oswald to his mother and were extraordinarily moving. I read and reread them before mentioning that I had found them and how moving they were. With a weak smile Mr Blencowe explained that they were from his brother who had been killed shortly after the last one was sent. He said he wanted to take two of them with him but that he would very much like me to have the other. I have treasured it ever since."

Jensen was born in Løgstør, Denmark, the third of four children. In 1908, he moved to England before he emigrated to Australia in March 1909 and worked in Australia for the next five years. A month after the war commenced, he was naturalised a British subject at Adelaide, South Australia, on 7 September 1914.[1]
Jensen served in the Australian Military Forces between March 1915 and December 1918.

When he was 26 years old and a Private in the 50th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.  Citation:
On 2 April 1917 at Noreuil, France, Private Jensen, with five comrades, attacked a barricade behind which were about 45 of the enemy and a machine-gun. One of the party shot the gunner and Private Jensen rushed the post and threw in a bomb. Then, with a bomb in each hand, he threatened the rest and made them surrender. He sent one of his prisoners to another group of the enemy, ordering them to surrender, which they did, but our troops began firing on them, where-upon Private Jensen, regardless of danger stood on the barricade waving his helmet, and the firing stopped. He then sent his prisoners back to our lines.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial. In Løgstør, Denmark, there is a statue erected in his memory in a park. The attached account of his actions was written by James Price Lloyd of the Welsh Regiment, who served with Military Intelligence. After the war, the government to destroyed all the archives relating to this propaganda (section MI 7b (1)). They were regarded as being too sensitive to risk being made public. Remarkably these documents have survived in the personal records of Captain Lloyd.

A six-day siege ensued when the 77th Division came under heavy bombardment from all sides, including at times from their own troops. Only 140 survived from an initial complement of 500 men in the 77th Division. My uncle James Bruton was killed on the last day of the siege.

He went into the line at Armentières, France, and served there until April 1917 when his unit moved into position for the Messines offensive. On 7 June, in the battle of Messines Ridge, he rushed an enemy trench and bayoneted four men, then rescued a comrade who was in difficulties. Later in the advance he attacked a machine-gun crew, killing three men and capturing the gun, and, in spite of heavy shelling and machine-gun fire, dug out two of his mates who had been buried by a shell explosion. During the battle his battalion was in the line for ninety-six hours and Carroll 'displayed most wonderful courage and fearlessness' throughout. He was awarded the Victoria Cross and in September was promoted lance corporal. On 12 October, in the second battle of Passchendaele, he was severely wounded and did not rejoin his unit until June 1918; next month he was transferred to A.I.F. headquarters, London, and in August returned to Australia.

This letter is important because the story behind it demonstrates how free speech, critical thinking and public education can buckle under war. At the time of the writing of this document, Hyman Herman was a 16 year old student at the DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, N.Y. Herman's letter to Wilson was actually completed as a homework assignment given to him by his English teacher, Samuel Schmalhausen, who asked his students to “write a frank letter to Woodrow Wilson commenting on his conduct of the war against the government of Germany.”
In 1917, Herman’s homework actually sparked a debate in the U.S. on the meaning of loyalty, patriotism, citizenship and the duty of the public school teacher during wartime. Schmalhausen’s assignments - in which students were required to think critically about the U.S. role in World War 1 - raised the eyebrows of several teachers and administrators at the DeWitt Clinton High School. Regarding Schmalhausen’s teaching as unpatriotic, disloyal and seditious, teachers and administrators agitated. The ultimate result was a trial in which Schmalhausen and two other teachers were accused and found guilty of “holding views subversive of discipline and tending to undermine good citizenship”. Herman’s homework - his letter to President Wilson - was a chief piece of evidence used to prove the case against the teachers. The homework was damning indeed and the three teachers were suspended. Schmalhausen appealed and lost but later became an author of several books including one entitled “Humanizing Education"". Young Hyman Herman provided testimony at the trial and publicly recanted the claims and apologized for his assignment in a school wide assembly. The trial occurred in early December 1917. The letter from Associate Superintendent Tildsley which accompanies Herman’s assignment is dated January 7, 1918. Naturally, as manager of several public schools, Warriner was very interested in the controversial homework at the center of the controversy and requested a copy Herman’s infamous assignment from the school administrator overseeing the DeWitt Clinton High School."

Edward William Bennett’s Service 1914 - 1920

 My father, Edward William Bennett, volunteered for service on the 7th of August 1914; just 3 days after war had been declared, aged 21. 
As a keen motorcyclist, he was drafted into the Royal Engineers Signals Depot, No 10 Motorcycle section as a dispatch rider (you had to provide your own motorcycle!).
 He was posted to France on the 15th of August as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and attached to the Headquarters of the 2nd Army


                
                                                                                                                                      
       
                                                                                                        Corporal Edward William Bennett Aug. 1914


Father said very little about his wartime experiences, the only period he did speak of were the early months in the Autumn of 1914, before the Western Front settled down to a static battle of opposing trench lines at the end of that year.
 He described how on one occasion he was speeding through the lanes of France, pursued by a German motorcyclist who was intent on capturing valuable intelligence, when he completely misjudged a corner and ploughed through a hedge into a field (his eyesight was always poor, even as a young man) and the relief he felt on hearing the German speed past on the road as he lay stunned on the ground.
On another occasion the headquarters had been set up in a deserted farmhouse and they had been lucky enough to catch a chicken and collect a good supply of eggs.  The bird was simmering nicely over a fire when word came that the Germans were rapidly advancing and it was necessary to move out at once. The transport was quickly loaded and at the last moment father dashed over to the fire and kicked the Billy can and its contents into the ashes to deny the Germans their chicken supper, vaulted over the back of the open topped staff car, landing on the eggs that had been stowed on the back seat!  
The most dangerous moment in these early days occurred when he was nearly shot by his own side. Something fell from his motorbike and he was searching for it by the feeble light of his shuttered headlight, when he was challenged by a sentry from the Anglian regiment. Having his ear by the engine which he kept running, father did not hear. He did however hear the shot and the tug on his coat as the .303 bullet tore into the cloth. I understand the sentry learned of his error in no uncertain way almost immediately. 
On close inspection no blood was found but that the bullet had sliced through the coat from hem to hip pocket then passed through his tin cigar case from edge to edge before passing harmlessly into the night. Having seen the case I can vouch for the fact it was only slightly thicker than the two bullet holes.
As a child I remember being terrified when he produced a cigar from the case, having told this story and proceeded to smoke it. I thought it was one of the original cigars and was convinced it would explode!
                                                                                                                              


Service with the MMGS

In January 1915 Sergeant Edward William Bennett volunteered for service in the newly formed Motor Machine Gun Section of the Machine Gun Corps, was commissioned to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant on the 9th of February, and posted to the 14th Battery

                                                                                          
         Formation and development 

Motorcycles and armoured cars were used from the earliest days of the war. Army order 480 dated the 12 of November and sanctioned in February 1915, approved the addition to each division of a motor machine gun battery. This was designated to be a unit of the Royal Field Artillery and was to be known as the Motor Machine Gun Service (MMGS). Soldiers for the service were found from enlisted men and volunteers known to be interested in motorcycles. The thinking behind the formation of the batteries was that they could act as a rapid reaction force; however by the time they saw action, the roads at the front, if they still existed, were so badly damaged that such operations were severely hampered.
By the start of the battle of Loos on the 25th of September 1915 there were eighteen Batteries, five of which were engaged at Loos.
Batteries of the MMGS typically included 18 motorcycle combinations, 6 Vickers machineguns with ammunition, 8 motorcycles without sidecars, 2 or 3 wagons or cars and a motorcycle     combination for the officer commanding.
The earliest motorcycles used were Scotts, with Matchless, Premier, Zenith, Enfield and Clyno machines entering service when it was found that the Scotts were insufficiently robust for active service.
The men of the MMGS wore an unusual uniform as shown in this photograph of Lieutenant Edward.W.Bennett, with leather boots in place of puttees. Cap badges were similar to the Machine Gun Corps. ( MGC), but with MMG lettering. The shoulder title was a brass MGC with a letter M underneath it. Gauntlets, goggles and weather proof garments were used for riding but no crash helmet. Note also that Lieut.Bennett has removed the wire stiffening from his service cap to produce the “Gorblimey“ style, an affectation only to be used by experienced campaigners of the BEF who joined up at the start of the war. 
By May of 1916 most of the Batteries had been withdrawn from Divisional command and attached as Corps Troops and by the end of 1916 many men were transferred to the Heavy Motor Machine Gun Corps later, to be known as the Tank Corps

By the 26th of January 1915 the 14th Battery had been formed and joined the 20th (Light) Division of the First Army 3rd Corps.  Following a period of training, in their base in Belton Park Grantham, the battery set sale for France. Disembarking at Le Havre on the 21st of July 1915, they moved up to the front line near Mauquissart, a hamlet just north of Neuve-Chapelle on the road to Fauquissart in northern France. (Now the D171 R.de Bois).                         

         
Before the Battle of Neuve-Chapelle in March 1915 which resulted in the capture of this town, Mauquissart was described as a cluster of ruined houses barely a quarter of a mile behind the German lines, on the left of the planned attack and directly in front of Aubers, which was on a ridge a mile beyond. Between them was the Moulin du Pietre a large double-storied working mill that had served local farmers for miles around. Beyond Mauquissart the enemy line began to curve, dipping back slightly behind the Ferme Vanbiesen a deserted and ruined large farm, almost a manor, surrounded by trees and a once ornamental waterscape that had doubled as a drainage ditch in the low lying farmland. British troops, looking from their own lines into no-mans land, christened it the Moated Grange.
                                                                                                                                 

Following the Battle of Neuve- Chapelle, the Allies had moved forward and prior to the battle of Loos now occupied the line of the German trenches described above, see trench map for July 1915

The Battle of Loos September 25th 1915

The timing of the attack on Loos, a mining town in northern France close to the Belgium border, was dictated by the French to support their own action elsewhere, as was the battle of the Somme a year later. 
To distract attention from the main target of Loos, it was decided to mount diversionary attacks simultaneously, one from Neuve-Chapelle/Mauquissart about 15 Km to the north, and the other from Ypres in Belgium

                                   . 




Field Marshal Sir John French was concerned that the severe shortage of artillery shells available at the time would jeopardize the success of the operation. He hoped that the availability of gas, which was to be used for the first time by the Allies, in retaliation for its use by the Germans who had attacked at Ypres behind a cloud of chlorine gas some time earlier, would compensate to some extent.

The British forces around Neuve-Chapelle were made up of  elements of the 20th Division, the Indian army Meerut Division, which in addition to Indian troops also contained a battalion of British regulars (as had been the case in India) and a battalion of Territorials or Special Reservists, and the Gurkha Rifles.
Stand To was set for 3.30am on the 25th and zero hour for 5.50. At Mauquissart the 3rd Londoners were ready to advance when the Gurkhas and the Leicesters had captured the first line of trenches and the gas detachment was standing by to release clouds of gas and smoke towards the German lines, to smother the enemy before the infantry attack. Meanwhile the bombardment was underway and the enemy guns were sending back shell for shell, nearer zero hour a rum ration would be given out, but well before this, disaster struck.
A German shell fell short of the trench, harmlessly it seemed but near enough to make the men duck involuntarily. After several minutes a cloud of gas drifted back over the trenches. The shell had landed on the gas bottles fracturing some of them and because of a change in the wind direction the escaping fumes were drifting everywhere other than towards the Germans, despite valiant attempts to stem the flow of escaping gas by piling sand bags on them. Man after man succumbed and at zero hour the Gurkhas donned gas helmets and charged through the clouds of gas and smoke. Not a good start. 
Initially significant gains were made; the 12th Rifle brigade reached and held the third line of German trenches but was so far ahead of the line they were in danger of becoming isolated. The Meerut Bareilly Brigade had done well too, but with no reserves following up they were driven back giving no option for the 12th Rifles than to retire, an action that cost them three hundred and twenty nine killed, wounded or missing in their brigade alone.
So at the end of the day the Allies in the Neuve-Chappell sector were back where they started, they had achieved the objective of keeping the Germans occupied but at a high cost.
Once again initial gains were lost because of the late arrival of support, due in the most part to the unavailability in those days of adequate battlefield communication and hence real time intelligence of the situation at the front, rather than just incompetence. Attacks carried on for several weeks, with further losses and no gains before petering out.

What action the 14th MMGS saw during this time or what  involvement  Leiut.E.W.Bennett had in the battle is not known, however it must have been notable to be drawn to Sir John French’s attention, who mentioned him in his despatch of the 30th of November, resulting in the award of the Military Cross (MC) for gallantry in the field.

Service in the Ypres Salient

Nothing is known of Lieutenant Bennett’s service between September 1915 and the spring of 1916, however by this time the 14th MMGS Battery was located in or around Ypres in Belgium.
On the 5th of March he was driving a motorcycle combination with his gunner in the sidecar on the Menim Road towards Sanctuary Wood, near Hell Fire Corner, when he was spotted by a German battery. When the shell exploded he took shrapnel in the neck, back and legs. (His gunner in the sidecar was less severely wounded and later returned to the front and was killed). On the 7th of March Lieutenant Bennett was admitted to the Red Cross Hospital at Le Touquet

During a long spell in hospital and convalescence between April 1916 to the 11th of December 1918 father was declared permanently unfit for active service. 
 Because of his pre war profession as a chemical engineer specialising in gas production (father was employed by the London Gaslight and Coke Company) he was attached to the newly formed Royal Air Force, and posted to the Airship Section in Dean Stanley Street Westminster, where between reoccurring bouts of illness, he was involved in the development of Airships such as the R33 and where he remained until the end of the war. 


                                                                                                                                                                                                     



After the war father tried his hand at farming in Kenya. I believe this was under the auspices of the BEADOC (British East African Disabled Officers Colony) scheme, to seek his fortune growing flax.  During this time it was reported by the British Army Medical Board in Kisumu on the 22nd of May 1920, that he had been in hospital in Nairobi for three weeks because the wound in his right leg started discharging. The same Board awarded Lieutenant E W Bennett MC (whose unit is now described as The RAF Reserve), a pension of £50 per annum.

The BEADOC scheme was ill conceived and under funded. Following the collapse of the flax market after the war (the price had been inflated by the wartime demands for flax for uniforms, aircraft skins and other stores) he, like most, found that it was impossible to make a living from the farm and returned to England. The lucky ones managed to sell their land to Brook Bond, who found it ideal for growing tea!

However, he looked forward to getting letters from her.

According to military records, Thomas served on a number of different ships.  HMS Edgar was used in Gallipoli so he may have been there. He boarded the ship in July 1915. I've made inquiries about Tom's military history via the Great War Forum. It seems that Tom survived the war, then married, lived in Oxford (St Clements) until he died in 1976.

Albert Walter Broughton was my great great grandfather and a private in the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry. He died on 28 Sept 1916.

He was in the 2nd/4th battalion which was a Territorial Unit.

Richard Knapp was my great great uncle. He was called Knapp because he was born before the marriage of his mother to Mr Hutchings – so he had his mother’s maiden name. It took his parents a long time to marry, perhaps not so uncommon in St Clements of Oxford where they lived which at the time was quite rough! At the age of 13 he worked on printing machines at Oxford University Press. He probably served overseas, possibly in the Territorial Force and then the Queens regiment at the end of the war. He received war medals in 1921 and was awarded the 1915 star in 1920. He served for six years and seven days. He was married in 1917 and died on 18 March 1925 aged 37.

He was a platoon sergeant from June 1915 to May 1917. He arrived in Le Havre on 26 January 1917 and kept a daily diary of the combat, but on 17 May 1917 went over the top. Fighting was fierce with many casualties and on 18 May was wounded by a &quot;whizz-bang&quot; in the back and head. He wrote to his parents on 20th May assuring his parents he was well and not severely injured, though having a shrapnel wound to his back. On the 24 May he was sent back to England and had surgery on 1st June at a hospital in Bristol to remove the shrapnel from near his spine. Attached are several moving letters from his family written around this time, detailing their thankfulness that he has survived &quot;only wounded&quot;.

After he had convalesced he did not return to active service, first serving as a drill seargent from August 1917 to October 1918 and then again as platoon sergeant until Jan 1919 when he was demobbed. He was married 5 years later on 9 August 1924.

His brothers Arthur Wesley and Herbert Stanley also enlisted and saw active service in France. Arthur Wesley Brush suffered mentally from all he had endured.

He rowed with Limerick Rowing Club. He fell out with his parents over his atheism. He spent a year working in the mines in Wales before returning home to Ireland. An uncle in Australia sent the fare for Thomas to emigrate to Sydney, where he had a job for him. Thomas arrived in Sydney c. June/July 1914. The job never materialised. For adventure, therefore, he joined the 13th Battalion. He died at Gallipoli on 9 August, 1915 aged 23. 

He was at the front for about a year and a half. He rowed onto the beaches at the Dardanelles and was one of only two survivors in his boat. That was his arrival at the front.

Cracker Jack is a popular caramel-coated popcorn snack, later to be associated with the sport of baseball in the minds of Americans. In 1918, Cracker Jack urged Americans to join the US Navy (their mascot was a boy in a sailor suit). Also, by eating the product, consumers could save valuable sugar and wheat for the war effort. The USA had just entered the war in 1917, so the patriotic fever was still strong with the American public.

105457,en,"Private John Robertson, Canadian Infantry, was awarded the V.C. for bravery near Passchendaele on 6th November 1917. He was killed during this action. Private Robinson was a soldier serving in the 27th Canadian Infantry (Manitoba Regiment) during the infamous Battle of Passchendaele. During an advance towards the German positions his platoon was held up by uncut wire and a machine gun causing many casualties. Robertson moved quickly to an opening on the flank, rushed the machine gun and, after a desperate struggle with the crew, killed four and then turned the gun on the remainder, who, overcome by the fierceness of his attack retreated by running towards their own lines. This brave action enabled the platoon to advance. He inflicted many more casualties among the enemy and then, carrying the captured machine gun, he led his platoon to the final objective where he selected an excellent position and got the gun again into action targeting the retreating enemy who by this time were quite demoralised by the fire brought to bear on them. During the consolidation of the new position Pte. Robertson continued to use the machine gun to bring down fire on enemy snipers; it is considered that this example of courage and coolness seemingly encouraged his comrades and inspired them to even greater efforts. Later, when two Canadian snipers were badly wounded in front of the trench he went out and carried one of them in under very heavy fire. Robertson was killed just as he returned with the second man.

105453,en,"Wilfred Edwards enlisted as Private in the 7th Battalion, The King&#039;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI)during the First World War and was awarded the VC for his actions on 16 August 1917 at Langemarck, Belgium, during the Battle of 3rd Ypres.  On that day the 7th KOYLI were tasked to advance and capture enemy positions to their front, unfortunately for them, besides trenches, they also contained concrete blockhouses from which the battalion was lashed by machine gun fire.  This caused the death or injury of all his company&#039;s officers, thereby creating confusion and halting the advance.  At this time Private Edwards, without hesitation and under heavy machine gun and rifle fire, ran forward and threw grenades (&#039;bombed&#039;) through the loopholes; he then, with enormous risk to himself, actually climbed on top of the construction and waved to his company to advance. Continuing aggression on his part was rewarded by the three German officers and 30 other ranks who occupied the blockhouse surrendering to him. Later during the advance he did most valuable work as a messenger(&#039;runner&#039;) and eventually guided most of the battalion out through very difficult ground, again a most dangerous task.

Edwards was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in December 1917 and was demobilised in June 1919. He re-enlisted in the army when World War II broke out and rose to the rank of Major.

Through photographs, poetry and witness statements, I can show how I believe the current crisis in Iraq stems directly from the involvement of British and Indian troops in the region during the First World War. A British and Indian force (Force D) landed at Fao on the Shatt al-Arab River on November 6, 1914, so this is the 100 year anniversary of the beginning of British involvement in that conflict (to protect the oil pipeline) which I believe led to our current involvement in the terrible devastation happening in that country.

119536,en,"E.C. Warriner gave this speech on October 2, 1915 at a teacher’s meeting in Saginaw, Michigan.
The document is important for several reasons. First, on page 11, Warriner describes the moment when he first learns about World War I from the papers - a moment which also involves a conversation with a stranger on the street of Mt. Pleasant, Michigan - thus the document serves as an honest account of an ‘ordinary conversation’ about the war from the “heartland’ of the United States.
Second, Warriner explains his disappointment and heartbreak, especially after the successes of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Peace Conferences and Carnegie’s acts of peace philanthropy.
Nevertheless, Warriner refuses to relinquish his faith and persists in his belief that the goals of the peace movement will eventually be realized. Thus, Document 3 is useful because it demonstrates a U.S. citizen’s faith in the peace through international arbitration movement, despite the unfortunate occurrence of World War I. Third, the essay complements Documents 1 (The notes for the speech 'Universal Peace and the School) and Document 4(Letter from Hyman Herman), because it is focused on the topic of patriotism and its relationship to public education and the duties of the teacher.
As Document 4 (Letter from Hyman Herman) illustrates, after the U.S. entered the war in 1917, the relationship amongst patriotism, public education and the duty of the teacher became rather contentious.
Document 1 (The notes for the speech 'Universal Peace and the School') which was written between 1910 and 1914 - provides a view of these things prior to the war.
Document 3 (Speech on Patriotism) which was written in 1915 and therefore prior to U.S. entry into the war, offers a glimpse into Warriner’s view of patriotism and education at this crucial time that differs from the views expressed in Document 1 (The notes for the speech 'Universal Peace and the School). In Document 3 (Speech on Patriotism), although identifying himself as an “advocate of peace and arbitration”, Warriner concludes that the war has demonstrated that since the world is only “partly hospitable”, “patriotism” therefore requires service to one’s country, and perhaps even the sacrifice of one’s life - until an effective world court is established. The patriotic duty of the teacher is to “teach that our pupils will unselfishly live for the country and if necessary die for it” and that “only a coward will shirk this duty.” Of course, Warriner’s view of courage and patriotism was not universally held among peace advocates. For instance, opposing Warriner’s views are those which regard conscientious objection as both a display of ‘true patriotism’ and real courage.
The Women’s International League of Peace and Freedom was one of several organizations which held and continue to hold this opposing view. This brings us to the fourth and final factor illustrating the importance of Document 3, namely that it can be used to stimulate an interesting debate on the nature of patriotism and courage - a question that poses as much relevance today as it did in 1915."

Michael was transferred to the labour corps, and after the armistice was sent back home to Longford on pension. The local doctor referred him to the Richmond Hospital in Dublin where he was X-rayed and it was only then that the bullet was located in his heart.

Prior to World War I the area that is now Latvia was in the Russian Empire, and was part of three gubernias (provinces): Courland, Livland, and Vitebsk. The First World War started in Russia on 1 August 1914. The main enemies were Germany and Austro-Hungary, but the Allies â€“ the countries of Entente Alliance (the French Republic, the British Empire and the USA). Starting with the first days of the World War I in addition to activating the regular army there started the mobilisation of the 18-43 old men subjected to conscription. Due to the patriotic feelings many men volunteered. Among them was JÄ�nis FÄ�rts who worked as a teacher in RÅ«jiena. JÄ�nis FÄ�rts ancestry comes from Viesiena â€“ a picturesque area at Lake VieÅ¡Å«rs (KaÄ·Ä«tis) and GaiziÅ†kalns, the highest hill of Latvia. JÄ�nis FÄ�rts was born on 8 February 1893 (according the old calendar on 29 January) at the household CigÄ¼i, Viesiena, the parish of Vestiena-Tolka (today the parish of Arona, the household ÄŒiglas). His father Andrejs was a country craftsman-shoemaker, mother Ieva took care of the large family with 5 children: JÄ�nis was the eldest, three younger brothers Nikolajs, Georgs, Andrejs, and sister Alma. JÄ�nis was one of the best pupils at the parish school, excellent in mathematics, but the family did not have financial means to support his further education. JÄ�nis acquired the necessary knowledge by self-instruction and went to St.Petersburg to take the teacherâ€™s exams; the money for the distant trip was saved by his mother's sister Aunt Ede SirmÄ�. First JÄ�nis FÄ�rts acquired the status of mathematics teacher (1911), a little later - the nature science teacher (1913). These are the subjects teacher JÄ�nis FÄ�rts taught at Marta StalaÅ¾a private progymnasium at RÅ«jiena until October 1914 when he started his military service. According the description of JÄ�nis FÄ�rts service (The National Archive of Latvia, LVVA- 5601.fonds, I.apr. , 1685.lieta):

Concise Memoirs from 1912 to 1917-1918
The Armenian Volunteer Movement in the United States of America in 1917
The â€œLÃ©gion dâ€™Orientâ€� (Eastern Legion)
I describe my memories of the active role in the Legion of the volunteers by natives from Kharpert in a very concise manner. It must be known to many how the Armenian Volunteer Legion was formed, first as the â€œLÃ©gion dâ€™Orientâ€� (Eastern Legion) and later by the name of the â€œLÃ©gion ArmÃ©nienneâ€� (Armenian Legion). In 1917, under the leadership of Boghos Noubar Pasha, an agreement was reached in Paris with the high-ranking French state authorities, by which an Armenian volunteer army was to be formed and sent against the common enemy, Turkey. On what basis and for how long this agreement was going to be in force was unknown to us, but we assumed that the liberation of the Armenian provinces and Cilicia was promised. In 1917, I responded to the draft callings that were published about the Armenian volunteer movement (the Armenian Legion). I, Sarkis Nadjarian, a native of Kharpert, was born in 1896 in the town of Chernig. As soon as I graduated from the Elementary School, I left for the United States of America, to the state of Boston, at the age of 16.
I witness from my memoirs as a volunteer that I had a moral obligation to my nation and my parents, with the content of fulfilling a revenge, having as an objective to inform the new generation and the general public about the Armenian volunteer, with his braveries, sacrifices and commendable services towards his nation and beloved people, especially those volunteers from Kharpert, Sebastia, Kessab, Ayntab, etc., who abandoned their families and work and every pleasure, enjoyment and comforts. They came from far away North America, leaving aside their profitable ventures, and were accompanied by Armenian volunteers from France, Egypt and Jebel Musa (Mousa Dagh), who threw themselves in the battle-field, suffering various sacrifices, even death, for the sake of their nationâ€™s freedom. They wrote a glorious page in history, with the brave victory of the Battle of Arara."

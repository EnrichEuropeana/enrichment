Photographs
Hello and many thanks for your help and information. It certainly adds credence to what I already know about the Shell casing. It originally was used as a dinner gong in the chap's house. I knew him well before he died. The house was is an old mill, situated between the villages of Moulton, Boughton and the then village of Kingsthorpe, on the edge of Northampton. An old chap told me that during the First World War, there was a nearby practice artillery range, although in know no more that that, perhaps you can cast more information on the subject ?
I assume that as it was a French or Belgian Shell, that it must have been used on the range ?
Martin Fryatt , 31st. May 2013
Sorry, but I don't know who you are ?

Shell Markings
1/. On side of casing ""To Jean from Uncle Ted 12-5-1919""
2/. On end of casing ""O"" with a dot in centre.
3/. ""FN"" , encircled/.
4/. 37
5/. April 1918.
""HJ"", J appears to be reversed, with ""25"" underneath it."

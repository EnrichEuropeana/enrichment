- to run the app, it is necessary to install the mysql because of the keword ui api. On the test server (Debian 9), please use this tutorial https://linuxconcept.com/install-mysql-on-debian-9-operating-system/.
When the istallation is finished create a required database (e.g. tp) by logging to the mysql: sudo mysql -u root -p, and then create the database with: CREATE DATABASE tp; To enable accessing the mysql without sudo,
please follow this guide: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281594/error-1698-28000-access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost, and in particular execute the option 1:

sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since it was a new installation
mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;
sudo service mysql restart

For Windows, use the windows installer (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) to install the mysql. Set the username and password which correspond to the ones in the application.properties file. To create a new
database called "tp", first add the mysql bin folder: C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin, to the system path variable. Then open the cmd editor and connect to the mysql as a root using the command: mysql -u root -p,
and type password as in the application.properties file. Then create the tp database with: CREATE DATABASE tp;

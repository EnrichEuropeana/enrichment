
*Integrated new Solr highlighter that can return the positions/offsets of the terms in the text:

- based on this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4722, the given .jar file returns only offsets in terms of where the given term is with regard to the number of 
words before the term. I have slightly changed the java file and used another provided function from the file that can return the positions in terms of characters and then 
repackaged the java file into another jar using eclipse (project: PositionsSolrHighlighter). The PositionsSolrHighlighter.java file is included in the enrichment-solr project 
and can be changed additionally with regard to the requirements.
